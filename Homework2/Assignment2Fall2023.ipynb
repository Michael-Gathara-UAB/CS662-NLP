    "* Please make sure your code does not contain absolute paths to your home directory. You can assume that any needed files are in your current directory when this is run\n",
    "* All code should run on cheaha job requesting no more than 64 GB of RAM\n",
    "* The cheaha server GPUs may or may not be available when you need them. You may need several hours for a GPU. For this reason, the last question is a bonus question. If you want to really learn neural networks I suggest you start early on this assignment.\n"

    "The training of Casual Language Models form the basis of the GPT-X series of Language Models and EleutherAI has attempted to replicate GPT-3 with its GPT-Neo models. While GPT-Neo models have had some exposure to biomedical (PubMed) text, they have not had exposure to GeneRIFs. Included in this assignment is a directory with a large GeneRIF data set version (100K) and a small GeneRIF data set version (1K) lines, each of which has its train, validation and test data sets. Using the gpt-neo-125M model (smallest available):\n",
    "* Perform Casual Language Modeling on the SMALL geneRif data set (65 points, ALL students) and compute validation loss over at least 5 epochs. You will not be graded on the quality of training on this data set, it has been provided to allow you to get your code working without regard as to your hyperparameter settings or machine learning skills.\n",
    "* Perform Casual Language Modeling on the LARGE geneRIF data set, this time optimize hyperparameters and show improvement in validation loss (30 points, PhD Required, MS Bonus). Do NOT attempt until you have it working on the smaller data set. Be attentive to memory constraints, you may run on ampere nodes and optionally use both GPUs.\n",
    "* Speculate on the performance of your best working model and why I gave you such a tiny (125M) model tfor this task. Why does it train or not train well? (5 points) Propose a way to evaluate your updated model (5 points). \n",
    "* Additional bonus are available for students who have high performing models above 110 points.\n",
