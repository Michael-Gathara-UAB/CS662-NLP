FTR67, a member of the fish-specific finTRIM family, triggers IFN pathway and against spring viremia of carp virus.
Within the endoderm induction pathway, mis is not required for the activation of early zygotic genes, but is essential to implement nodal activity downstream of casanova/sox 32 but upstream of sox17 expression
Dioxin-responsive cDNAs encoding putative calcium-binding proteins have been isolated from zebrafish and trout. These sequences are 88% similar to each other at the amino acid level and are orthologs of the human S100A4 calcium-binding protein.
ictacalcin is expressed in skin during zebrafish embryogenesis
p53 synthesis is affected in zebrafish tumors with ribosomal protein gene mutations
