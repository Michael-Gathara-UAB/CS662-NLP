Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin and AgRP neurons are hypophysiotropic, projecting to the pituitary to coordinately regulate multiple pituitary hormones.
We identify the neuronal regulatory region of zebrafish pomca and confirm that it is not homologous to the mammalian enhancers.
The evolution of pomc, pmch and pmchl genes and acquisition of hormonal status for MCHL explain different mechanisms used by vertebrates to background-adapt
Hyperandrogenism in POMCa-deficient zebrafish enhances somatic growth without increasing adiposity.
cloning of the gene and cDNA encoding cGnRH-II from zebrafish; in situ hybridization analysis of expression in adult zebrafish brains; levels quantified in the pituitary
