We show that Kif7 interacts with both Gli1 and Gli2a and suggest that it functions to sequester Gli proteins in the cytoplasm, in a manner analogous to the regulation of Ci by Cos2 in Drosophila.
a new mechanism of Gli transcription factor activation and implicate ARHGAP36 dysregulation in the onset and/or progression of GLI-dependent cancers.
Mutation of hmgcs1 had no effect on Shh signaling at 2 and 3 days post fertilization (dpf), but did result in a decrease in the expression of gli1, a known Shh target gene, at 4 dpf, after morphological deficits in craniofacial development and chondrocyte differentiation were observed in hmgcs1 mutants.
Data identify core coding region sequence determinants within the SELENOP mRNA that govern SELENOP synthesis. The N-terminal coding sequence (upstream of the second UGA) and C-terminal coding sequence context are two independent determinants for efficient synthesis of full-length SELENOP. In addition, the distance between the first UGA and the consensus signal peptide is also critical for efficiency.
