Zebrafish etv5a is essential for the inhibition of ventral mesoderm cell proliferation and for the formation of the hemato-vascular lineage.
etv5a and etv4 have roles in mediating epithelial cell fate during zebrafish kidney development
Developmental regulation of zOGT transcriptional variants generated by alternative splicing and characterization of their OGT activities of protein O-GlcNAcylation.
Overexpression of Ogt delayed epiboly and caused a severe disorganization of the microtubule and actin based cytoskeleton in the extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer.
We identify a TET1 domain that is necessary and sufficient for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the TET1-OGT interaction.show that this interaction is necessary for TET1 to rescue hematopoetic stem cell production in tet mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1's function during development.
