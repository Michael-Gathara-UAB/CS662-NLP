Sulf1 triggers Shh signaling activity to establish and, later on, modify the spatial arrangement of gene expression in ventral neural progenitors
Sulfatases, in Particular Sulf1, Are Important for the Integrity of the Glomerular Filtration Barrier in Zebrafish.
correlation between the expression of t-bet, stat6 and foxp3 with other genes involved in Th and T(reg) responses
this study shows that STAT6 negatively regulates IFNphi1 production by attenuating the kinase activity of TANK-binding kinase 1
These results reveal a crosstalk between neurons and immune cells mediated by IL4/STAT6 signaling, which induces neural stem/progenitor cell plasticity in zebrafish brains.
