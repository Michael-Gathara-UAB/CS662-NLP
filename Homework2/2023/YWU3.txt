Mib-Jag1-Notch signalling regulates patterning and structural roles of the notochord by controlling cell-fate decisions
mind bomb mutants have downregulation of several genes necessary for GABA-mediated signaling. Spontaneous seizures are seen in these animals.
Data indicate a general down-regulation of Notch signaling genes necessary for proper brain development in mind bomb-mutant zebrafish embryos.
Mib and Mib2 interact with Fih-1 that is involved in the hypoxia signaling pathway.
forms of DeltaD that have the MID can activate Notch in trans and suppress early neurogenesis when mRNA encoding it is ectopically expressed in zebrafish embryos.
