SDF1/CXCR4-mediated cell migration is preferentially associated with movement along the anteroposterior axis of the animal
SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling is important for guiding retinal ganglion cell axons within the retina to the optic stalk to exit the retina.
Sdf1a/Cxcr4a plays a critical role in fin regeneration and more precisely in epidermal cell proliferation, an important process for blastema formation
results reveal a role for chemokine signaling in mediating the self-organizing migration of tissues during morphogenesis
Sdf1 is a key molecule in pigment pattern formation, adding to the growing inventory of its roles in embryonic development.
