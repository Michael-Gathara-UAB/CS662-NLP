formulate a mathematical model of a laser ablated primordium separated into two smaller cell collectives: a leading collective that responds to local CXCL12a levels and a trailing collective that migrates up a local FGF gradient.
snail1b expression is initiated by chemokines first encountered by leading primordium cells and its expression plays a crucial role in initiating collective migration of the posterior lateral line primordium.
Cxcl12 and Myc facilitate glycolysis to promote fast migratory responses during development and repair during kidney injury and development
The CXCL12/CXCR4 Signaling Axis Retains Neutrophils at Inflammatory Sites in Zebrafish.
The complex regulation patterns suggest roles for Cntn1a in myelinating cells and neurons particularly in successful CNS regeneration.
