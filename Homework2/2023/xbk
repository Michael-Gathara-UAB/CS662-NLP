Data establish that PERE is a novel cis-acting element contributing to pineal-specific gene expression and to Otx target gene regulation.
Genetic deciphering of the antagonistic activities of the melanin-concentrating hormone and melanocortin pathways in skin pigmentation.
cloning and characterization of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene
Zebrafish proopiomelanocortin (zfPOMC) contains the consensus sequences for ACTH, gamma-LPH, beta-MSH and beta-endorphin (beta-END). RT-PCR expression studies indicate that zfPOMC is selectively expressed in nervous tissue and in the pituitary gland.
Pituitary expression of proopiomelanocortin provides a unique marker for pituitary anterior and intermediate lobe morphogenesis.
