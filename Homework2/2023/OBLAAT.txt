Mosaic analysis indicates that the bronchiomotor neurons patterning and fusion defects in the mib hindbrain arise non-cell autonomously.
The three functionally distinct modules of Mind bomb work cooperatively to regulate Notch signaling by associating with, ubiquitinating, and internalizing Delta.
Here we further demonstrated that zebrafish Mib and Mib2, similar to their mouse orthologs, have a C-terminal-most RING finger-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Mib and Mib2 are reciprocal E3 ubiquitin ligases and substrates.
Zebrafish Mib and Mib2 are colocalized in transfected cells and function redundantly in regulating Notch signaling in embryos.
The mib ( ta52b ) mutation may affect not only neurogenesis but also mesoderm development. These results provide new insights into Notch signaling pathway.
