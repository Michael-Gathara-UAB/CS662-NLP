Endogenous levels of SDF1 antagonize the repellent effects of slit/robo signaling in vivo and is important during axonal pathfinding.
during early myogenesis Sdf1a co-operates with the second Cxcr4 of zebrafish - Cxcr4a resulting in the commitment of myoblast to form fast muscle
chemokine signaling contributes to both the olfactory placode assembly and the olfactory sensory neurons axon pathfinding in zebrafish
SDF1a directly controls the migration of both leading and trailing edges of a tissue through the activation of two independent receptors, CXCR4b and CXCR7.
Study demonstrates that the activity of a SDF-1a receptor, CXCR7, is crucial for proper migration of primordial germ cells toward their targets.
