neuropilin 1 can facilitate downstream signaling to promote angiogenesis.
Sema3D acts in concert with Nrp1a to guide neurons on the left side of the brain to innervate the target nucleus differently than those on the right side.
Elevated cyclicAMP levels promote Neuropilin-1a expression in retinal ganglion cells.
Nrp1 in endothelial cells suppresses TGFbeta activation and signaling by forming intercellular protein complexes with beta8 integrin.
repression of NRP1 by the HIF1alpha-E2F7 complex regulates spinal motor neuron axon guidance in vivo
