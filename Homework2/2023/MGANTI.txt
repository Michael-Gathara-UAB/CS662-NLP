A specific role for SynJ1 in autophagosomal and endosomal trafficking is described and evidence that PI(4,5)P2 participates in autophagy in cone photoreceptors is provided.
Zebrafish possess two genes, sept9a and sept9b that, like humans, express multiple transcripts.
Zebrafish sulf1 and sulf2a are broadly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and non-neuronal tissue including heart, somite boundaries, olfactory system, and otic vesicle.
Data indicate that sulf1 plays a crucial role in modulating both BMP and FGF signaling.
lack of SULF1 expression downregulates VEGFA-mediated arterial marker expression, confirming that Sulf1 mediates arterial specification by regulating VegfA165 activity.
