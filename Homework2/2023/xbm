GnRH loss-of-function affects early brain and eye formation during development.
Results show that the Notch-regulated ankyrin repeat protein (Nrarp) acts as a molecular link between Notch- and Lef1-dependent Wnt signaling in endothelial cells to control stability of new vessel connections in mouse and zebrafish.

Neuropilin 1a is required for vascular development and is a mediator of VEGF-dependent angiogenesis in zebrafish.
neuropilin-1a in primary motor neurons may integrate signals from several ligands
