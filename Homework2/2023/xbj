Evolution of mc1r in zebrafish is reported.
This study demonstrated a direct role for mc1r in zebrafish melanosome dispersal in response to background, and used chemical modification of this pathway to uncover a possible new layer of regulation in melanosome dispersal in zebrafish.
loss-of-function of mc1r causes a reduction of countershading and a general paling of the animals.
zfMC2R is not functional in the absence of MRAP expression.
sp5 transcription factors mediate the downstream responses to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in several developmental processes in zebrafish.
