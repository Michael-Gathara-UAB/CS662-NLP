Study shows that the primordium generates an attractant gradient across itself by sequestering Sdf1a protein in its rear via Cxcr7-mediated chemokine uptake. This self-generated attractant gradient, combined with the route information provided by the stripe of sdf1a-expressing cells, then provides directional guidance to the migrating primordium.
Prospective isolation and culture of sdf1(DsRed) perivascular cells demonstrated properties consistent with mesenchymal stem cells.
Our data show that elevated concentrations of circulating CXCL12a in pulmonary hypertension predicted poorer survival
filopodia distribution and their dynamics are dictated by the gradient of the chemokine Cxcl12a.
miR-126a directs lymphatic endothelial cell sprouting and extension by interacting with Cxcl12a-mediated chemokine signaling and Vegfc-Flt4 signal axis.
