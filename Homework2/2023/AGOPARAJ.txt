myeloperoxidase and H2O2 interact directly within neutrophils at the tissue wound
mpx expression is controlled differently in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm and posterior lateral plate mesoderm regions and describe novel roles for etv2 and gata1 during primitive neutropoiesis.
When infiltrated with Candida albicans, smu681 myeloperoxidase-deficient embryos and sibling embryos showed similar survival. Proliferation of C. albicans was more rapid in smu681 embryos than in sibling embryos, although it was eventually suppressed.
The initial characterization of wdr68 suggests an important role in craniofacial development for the highly conserved Wdr68-Dyrk1 protein complexes.
we show that while a GFP-Wdr68 fusion functionally substituted for craniofacial development in the zebrafish, that a Nuclear Export Signal (NES) fusion protein (GFPNESWdr68) failed to support craniofacial development
