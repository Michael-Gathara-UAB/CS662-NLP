sdf-1 expression and function in the adult zebrafish have important similarities to mammals
A single amino acid exchange switches the relative affinity of the Cxcl12 ligands for one of the duplicated Cxcr4 receptors, thereby determining the functional specialization of each chemokine that elicits a distinct function in a distinct process.
gata4 gene regulates sdf1a levels during early embryogenesis
These findings suggest an "attractive path" model in which migrating cells closely follow a dynamic SDF1a source that is refined on a transcript and protein level by miR-430 and Cxcr7b, respectively.
Study demonstrates that forced expression of Sdf1a in the fish embryo during early development is an effective strategy to disrupt primordial germ cell migration and produce large populations of infertile fish.
