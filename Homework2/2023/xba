This study investigated deiodinase 1 (Dio1), deiodinase 2 (Dio2), and deiodinase 3 (Dio3) mRNA expression at the several zebrafish life stages and found life stage specific expression of these genes that were highly localized.
Knockdown of D1+D2 (D1D2MO) and knockdown of D3 (D3MO) both resulted in transcriptional regulation of energy metabolism and (muscle) development in abdomen and tail
essential to assure normal development
In zebrafish embryos, D2 knockdown increased mortality during pneumococcal meningitis.
multiple compensatory mechanisms lead to normoglycemia in older Dio2 knockout zebrafish, despite persistent T3 deficiency
