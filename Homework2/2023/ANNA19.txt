membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase, zmmp-2, and tissue inhibitor 2 of metalloproteinases mRNA transcripts were expressed in the blastema
Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone alter expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the embryonic zebrafish.
Mmp2 facilitates endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition via ECM remodeling.
Overexpression of setd3 decreased cell viability and activated caspase-3, indicating possible roles in apoptotic cell death and cell cycle regulation.
deficiency of PRSS23 in zebrafish embryos inhibited the initiation of the endothelial to mesenchymal transition which resulted in atrioventricular canal malformation.
