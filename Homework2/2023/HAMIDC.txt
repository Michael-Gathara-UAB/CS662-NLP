Prrx1b, a Prx-related homeobox protein, participates in the regulation of vmhc expression with other transcriptional factors.
heterozygous chihuahua fish have phenotypic similarities to human osteogenesis imperfecta; mapping and molecular characterization of the chihuahua mutation indicates that the defect resides in the gene encoding the collagen I(alpha1) chain
ven though in adult bone, skin and scales equal amounts of a1(col1a1a) a2(col1a2) and a3(col1a2)chains are present, the presented data suggest a tissue-specific stoichiometry and/or post-translational modification status for collagen type I
Spatio-temporal expression and distribution of collagen VI during zebrafish development.
A novel de novo mutation in COL1A1 leading to osteogenesis imperfecta confirmed by zebrafish model.
