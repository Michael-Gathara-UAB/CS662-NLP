we show that minimal amounts of Fgfr1a or Fgfr2 are required to initiate a regulatory cascade in pharyngeal endoderm reducing expression of fsta, thereby allowing correct BMP signaling to the maturing chondrocytes of the head cartilage.
DHHC zinc finger gene, expressed in somites and lens during zebrafish embryogenesis
Our findings indicate that the reduced postsynaptic receptor density resulting from defective rapsyn contributes to weakness, but is not solely responsible for use-dependent fatigue
DNA Methylation Profiles of Tph1A and BDNF in Gut and Brain of L. Rhamnosus-Treated Zebrafish.
A trail of SDF1-like chemokine encoded by the sdf1a gene is present along the pathway of the lateral line primordium. Both the formation and the innervation of this system depend on the SDF1-CXCR4 system
