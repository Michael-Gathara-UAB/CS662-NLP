This protein was isolated, characterized and examined for enzymatic activities using a variety of endogenous compounds as substrates.
SULT2 ST2 and SULT2 ST3 showed distinct patterns of expression during embryonic development and throughout the larval stage onto maturity.
Our results suggest that Unc119c is the only Unc119 paralog that is highly specific to the retina in zebrafish. Unc119c and Arl3l2 proteins are important for the function of cones.
Cvl2 was identified as an essential pro-bone morphogenetic protein factor during zebrafish embryogenesis.
Bmper is a conserved regulator of hematopoietic and vascular development in zebrafish.
