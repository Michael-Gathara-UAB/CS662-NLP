sdf1-expressing mesodermal cells, which overlie the endodermal layer, guide the cxcr4a-expressing endodermal cells to the dorsal side of the embryo during gastrulation
Fgf and Sdf-1 pathways interact during zebrafish fin regeneration
Study suggest that the Cxcl12a-Cxcr4b ligand-receptor pair are involved in the migration of GnRH3 neurons in zebrafish, and are therefore crucial for the development of this system.
Expression of Cxcl12 and Cxclr4 in radial glial cells of the adult zebrafish brain supports important roles for the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 pair in brain development and functioning.
we demonstrate that miR-430-mediated regulation of endogenous sdf1a and cxcr7b facilitates dynamic expression of sdf1a by clearing its mRNA from previous expression domains.
