this study identifies a transcriptional switch involving the kinase Btk29A/Btk and its phosphorylation target, beta-catenin, which functions downstream of Wnt4 in escort cells to terminate Drosophila germ cell proliferation through up-regulation of piwi expression.
Btk29A is required non cell-autonomously for the invagination of the spiracular chamber in Drosophila
dissociation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Arm from DE-cadherin allows dynamic actin to reorganize, leading to ring canal expansion and cell shape changes during the course of oogenesis
Btk29A(ficP) mutant males null for the Btk29A type 2 isoform, a fly homolog of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Btk, show no courtship suppression, while Btk29A hypomorphic males exhibit a complete loss in courtship suppression within 30 min.

pipe repression depends on the TGFalpha-like ligand Gurken, which activates the Drosophila EGF receptor in dorsal follicle cells.
mutation in the Drosophila Chk2 homolog (DmChk2/Mnk) suppresses the defects in the translation of gurken mRNA and also the defects in oocyte nuclear morphology
Bruno binds specifically to the gurken 3'UTR and that the dorso-ventral defects caused by Bruno over-expression are due to a reduction of Gurken levels in the oocyte, Bruno plays similar roles in translational regulation of gurken and oskar.
The two steps of gurken RNA transport occur on distinct arrays of microtubules. Such microtubule networks could provide a mechanism for one motor to transport different cargos to distinct subcellular destinations.
Data show that Squid (Sqd) interacts with Hrb27C, and that Ovarian tumor (Otu) cooperates with Hrb27C and Sqd in the oocyte to mediate proper gurken (grk) localization.

Results show that Gurken travels towards the lateral/posterior of the egg chamber in the absence of Cbl, suggesting that Cbl actively regulates Gurken distribution through promoting endocytosis and subsequent degradation.
a mitotic cell cycle checkpoint may impinge on grk expression, much as meiotic checkpoints can alter expression of this gene
Glorund is part of a complex containing the hnRNP protein Hrp48 and the splicing factor Half-pint and plays a role in gurken and oskar regulation.
Data suggest that that Squid interacts with gurken mRNA in the nurse cell nuclei and, together with other factors, maintains gurken in a translationally silent state during its transport to the dorsal anterior region of the oocyte.
Glycosphingolipids are necessary for full activation of the EGFR pathway during oogenesis in a time-dependent manner.
Bicaudal C and trailer hitch interact genetically. Mutants of these two genes have shared defects in localization of gurken and other anteriorly-localized mRNAs, as well as altered microtubule organization which may underlie the mRNA localization defects.
Germline clones of mutant Sec61beta show normal translocation of Gurken into the ER and transport to the Golgi complex, but further traffic to the plasma membrane is impeded. The defect in plasma membrane traffic is specific for Gurken.
Data indicate that trapping at the anterodorsal corner requires at least one as-yet-unidentified gurken RLE.
A new pathway is identified that mediates cell-type and branch-specific synaptic repulsion, a novel role for EGFR signaling in synaptic target selection, and an unexpected role for Gurken as a muscle-secreted repulsive ligand.

The translational regulation of gurken protein in nurse cells, where the transcript is synthesized, occurs by a different mechanism from that of oskar protein and bicoid protein mRNA in the oocyte.
sites phosphorylated by CK2 overlap with active Orb and with Gurken protein expression.
The study suggests that both the localization and the translation of gurken mRNA in the vitellarium is independent from Vasa.

Va-A1 neurons terminally differentiate into DH31/AstA-expressing neurons (neuropeptidergic fate I) by virtue of Ubx activity, and Va-A2-A4 neurons terminally differentiate into Capa-expressing neurons
Both ROS and TRPA1 are required in a subset of anterior enteroendocrine cells for the release of the DH31 neuropeptide which activates its receptor in the neighboring visceral muscles. The resulting contractions of the visceral muscles favors quick expulsion of opportunistic bacteria, limiting their presence in the gut.
