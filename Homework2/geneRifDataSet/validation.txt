pipe repression depends on the TGFalpha-like ligand Gurken, which activates the Drosophila EGF receptor in dorsal follicle cells.
mutation in the Drosophila Chk2 homolog (DmChk2/Mnk) suppresses the defects in the translation of gurken mRNA and also the defects in oocyte nuclear morphology
Bruno binds specifically to the gurken 3'UTR and that the dorso-ventral defects caused by Bruno over-expression are due to a reduction of Gurken levels in the oocyte, Bruno plays similar roles in translational regulation of gurken and oskar.
The two steps of gurken RNA transport occur on distinct arrays of microtubules. Such microtubule networks could provide a mechanism for one motor to transport different cargos to distinct subcellular destinations.

a mitotic cell cycle checkpoint may impinge on grk expression, much as meiotic checkpoints can alter expression of this gene
Glorund is part of a complex containing the hnRNP protein Hrp48 and the splicing factor Half-pint and plays a role in gurken and oskar regulation.

Glycosphingolipids are necessary for full activation of the EGFR pathway during oogenesis in a time-dependent manner.
Bicaudal C and trailer hitch interact genetically. Mutants of these two genes have shared defects in localization of gurken and other anteriorly-localized mRNAs, as well as altered microtubule organization which may underlie the mRNA localization defects.

Data indicate that trapping at the anterodorsal corner requires at least one as-yet-unidentified gurken RLE.
A new pathway is identified that mediates cell-type and branch-specific synaptic repulsion, a novel role for EGFR signaling in synaptic target selection, and an unexpected role for Gurken as a muscle-secreted repulsive ligand.

The translational regulation of gurken protein in nurse cells, where the transcript is synthesized, occurs by a different mechanism from that of oskar protein and bicoid protein mRNA in the oocyte.
sites phosphorylated by CK2 overlap with active Orb and with Gurken protein expression.
The study suggests that both the localization and the translation of gurken mRNA in the vitellarium is independent from Vasa.

Va-A1 neurons terminally differentiate into DH31/AstA-expressing neurons (neuropeptidergic fate I) by virtue of Ubx activity, and Va-A2-A4 neurons terminally differentiate into Capa-expressing neurons

These results show that the two potential Cdk1 phosphorylation sites on Drosophila Cdc27 are required for its chromosomal localisation during mitosis and imply that these localisations specific to Cdc27 are crucial for APC/C functions.
Based on the results obtained, it was presupposed that distribution of annulate lamellae containing cytoplasmic pores could reflect the inactivation of the mitotic kinase cdk1 in Drosophila syncytial embryos.
Phosphorylation of Cdk1 on Y15 appeared to be crucial for developmental and DNA damage-induced G2-phase checkpoint arrest, consistent with other evidence that Myt1 is the major Y15-directed Cdk1 inhibitory kinase at this stage of development.

Data show that bHLHb22 protein daughterless (Da) binding alters the turnover parameters of bHLHc28 protein scute (Sc).
Notch signaling activates the expression of extramacrochaetae (emc), which encodes a helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor. Emc, in turn, then forms a biochemical complex with Da.
Daughterless and Tcf4 are expressed in postmitotic neurons in Drosophila melanogaster and mice, respectively, where they function to restrict neurite branching and synapse formation in part by restricting the expression of the cell adhesion molecule Neurexin.
Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers. Emc is destabilized in proneural regions by local competition for heterodimer formation by proneural bHLH proteins including Atonal or AS-C proteins.
Suppression of da by wild-type emc was essential for cell chirality formation and for normal left-right asymmetric development of the embryonic hindgut.

Drosophila Piwi functions downstream of piRNA production mediating a chromatin-based transposon silencing mechanism in female germ line.
in transgenic flies with the DDX catalytic triad of PIWI mutated, neither primary nor secondary piRNA biogenesis is detectably affected, transposons remain repressed, and fertility is normal
Piwi plays multiple roles in the piRNA pathway, in part enforcing transposon repression through effects on local chromatin states and transcription but also participating in germ cell piRNA biogenesis
Piwi identifies targets complementary to the associated piRNA and induces transcriptional repression by establishing a repressive chromatin state when correct targets are found.
REVIEW: new findings reveal the Piwi-piRNA pathway as a more general mechanism of gene regulation
Drosophila piwi mutants exhibit germline stem cell tumors that are sustained by elevated Dpp signaling.The direct requirement for Piwi for normal germline formation is largely restricted to larval stages.
HP1a profiles in piwi mutant animals confirm that Piwi depletion leads to decreased HP1a levels in pericentric heterochromatin, particularly in transposable elements .
Piwi is required in multiple cell types to control gerline stem cell lineage development in the Drosophila ovary.
The results demonstrate that a significant increase in the H3K4me2 level upon nuclear Piwi loss is not accompanied by the alterations in H3K9me3 and HP1a levels for several germline-expressed transposons, suggesting that in this case Piwi prevents transcription by a mechanism distinct from H3K9 methylation.
The results lead us to propose that the interaction between Su(var)3-7 and piwi or aubergine controls important developmental processes independently of transposon silencing.
This reporter platform will facilitate future dissections of the PIWI-targeting mechanism.
These results implicate Piwi in RNA polymerase activity modulation and stress response in the nucleolus. We discuss possible noncanonical Piwi functions along with its canonical role in transposon silencing by piRNAs.
Functions of piRNAs and the Piwi Protein in Drosophila
Piwi nuclear localization in somatic cells is required for differentiation.  Piwi regulates the somatic expression of Fasciclin 3 in gonadal development.

UVRAG-mutated heterotaxy patient cells also display highly increased Notch protein levels
The UVRAG-containing PI3K (III) complex is required for receptor downregulation through endolysosomal degradation and for the establishment of proper cell polarity in the developing wing.
Results indicate that a portion of Brf1 is sandwiched between Bdp1 and TBP upstream of the U6 TATA box. Furthermore, Bdp1 traverses the DNA under the N-terminal stirrup of TBP to interact with the DNA (and very likely Brf1) downstream of the TATA sequence.
Bdp1 recruitment requires that DmSNAPc be bound to a U6 PSE rather than a U1 PSE. This is consistent with the concept that DmSNAPc adopts different conformations on U6 and U1 PSEs, which lead to the subsequent recruitment of distinct general transcription factors and RNA polymerases for U6 and U1 gene transcription.
Assembly of SNAPc, Bdp1, and TBP on the U6 snRNA Gene Promoter in Drosophila melanogaster.
results indicate that Loqs and Dicer-1 form a complex that converts pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs
findings show that normal processing of Drosophila pre-miRNAs by Dicer-1 requires the double-stranded RNA-binding domain protein Loquacious (Loqs)
R3D1-L functions in concert with Dicer-1 in miRNA biogenesis and is required for reproductive development
Loqs is required intrinsically for germline stem cell maintenance.
Both domains of Loqs-PB are required for efficient miRNA production by enhancing the affinity of Dcr-1 for pre-miRNA.
Loquacious protein is not critical for assembly of microRNA as shown in dicer-1 knockout egg extract.
Drosophila Rax (dRax) is important for embryonic development.
Biogenesis of endo-siRNAs depends on a new isoform of the dsRNA-binding domain protein Loquacious, which is distinct from the isoform acting in the miRNA pathway.
Loqs and R2D2 act sequentially in the siRNA pathway in Drosophila, with Loqs primarily required for dsRNA processing.
Alternative splicing of the loquacious (loqs)mRNA generates three distinct Dicer partner proteins.
R2D2 and Loqs-PD have partially overlapping function.
Data show that dmDcr-2's partner protein, Loquacious-PD, alters termini dependence, enabling dmDcr-2 to cleave substrates normally refractory to cleavage.
Loqs binds to dmDcr1 as a monomer using the identified dimerization surface, which suggests that Loqs might form dimers under conditions where dmDcr1 is absent or not accessible
Loqs may have roles in assisting the de novo emergence of miRNA genes by facilitating dicing of suboptimal hairpin substrates.
Partial reconstitution of the RNAi response in human cells has been demonstrated using Drosophila gene products, DCR-2, Loqs-PD, and R2D2.
studies indicate that the 22 amino acids at the C terminus of Loqs-PD, including an FDF-like motif, directly interact with the Hel2 subdomain of Dicer-2's helicase domain. This interaction is RNA-independent, but we find that modulation of Dicer-2 cleavage also requires dsRNA binding by Loqs-PD.
binding preference for the thermodynamically more stable siRNA end by Loqs-PD alone is greatly amplified in complex with Dcr-2 to initiate strand discrimination by asymmetry sensing in the RISC loading complex.
We also found that a base-mismatch can enable Loqs-PB to tune miRNA length. We speculate that Loqs-PB tunes miRNA length by changing the conformation of base-mismatched nucleotides in the pre-miRNA stem to that of base-matched ones.
Loqs-PD removes the inhibitory effect of inorganic phosphate on Dicer-2 processing of blunt-end hairpin RNAs, allowing siRNA production in the presence of inorganic phosphate.

Kuzbanian acts during lateral inhibition within the cardiac primordium. Furthermore we discuss a second function of Kuzbanian in heart cell morphogenesis.
Notch activation and KUZ expression are restricted to border cells at stage 9 of oogenesis
Kuz regulates Notch signaling primarily by activating the Notch receptor and has little overall effect on signaling via disabling Delta.
indicates that KUZ is required to facilitate a functional Notch signal in the Notch-dependent cell for correct cell fate specification
IMP regulates Notch signalling by controlling the localisation of Kuzbanian to the apical domain, where Notch cleavage occurs, revealing a novel regulatory step in the Notch pathway.

found a correlation between the depth of integration of individual p38 kinases into the protein interaction network and their functional significance; propose a central role of p38b in the p38 signaling module with p38a and p38c playing more peripheral auxiliary roles
The interaction of any of several Drosophila Delta class glutathione transferases and p38b mitogen-activated protein kinase can affect the substrate specificity of either enzyme, which suggests induced conformational changes affecting catalysis.
Data show that the genetic interaction between p38b MAPK and Rack1 controls muscle aggregate formation, locomotor function, and longevity.
Taken together, our findings indicate that the p38 MAP Kinase is an integral component of the core circadian clock of Drosophila in addition to playing a role in stress-input pathways.
data suggest that p38Kb may affect circadian locomotor rhythms through the regulation of multiple downstream pathways

rickets appears to encode a component of the bursicon response pathway
Bursicon is a heterodimeric cystine knot protein that activates G protein-coupled receptor LGR2.
Membrane-anchored bursicon constructs were generated that can activate or inhibit membrane rk signaling.
2 alleles of the gene rickets (rk) encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor were isolated. The rk alleles result in border cell migration defects in a significant fraction of egg chambers. The rk receptor appears to regulate detachment and polarity of the border cell cluster coordinating processes within the cells of the cluster themselves.
In Drosophila, rk function is required for the normal maturation of the fly's cuticular hydrocarbon (CH) profile, with flies mutant for rk function showing dramatically elevated levels of CHs. This effect is mostly abrogated by mutations in the Delta9 desaturase encoded by the desaturase1 gene, suggesting that desaturase1 acts downstream of rk.

role as an enhancer trap that monitors male-specific gene expression in germ cells
snail is required for Drosophila gastrulation and is not replaceable by Escargot or Worniu.
esg must be ectopically expressed during nervous system development to reduce seizure susceptibility in adult drosophila.
Escargot directly interact with Daughtherless and its mammalian homologue HEB and eliminate them through siah-1 mediated protein degradation.
Escargot protein as an essential factor is required in hub cells for maintaining niche integrity by blocking conversion of hub cells to the cyst cell lineage.
Cell type-specific transcriptome analysis combined with Dam-ID binding studies identified Esg as a major repressor of differentiation genes in stem and progenitor cells.
Authors demonstrate that Esg plays a pivotal role in intestinal homeostasis, maintaining the stem cell pool while influencing fate decisions through modulation of Notch activity.
Robust intestinal homeostasis relies on cellular plasticity in enteroblasts mediated by miR-8-Escargot switch.
CySCs mutant for esg are not maintained as stem cells, but remain capable of differentiating normally along the cyst cell lineage. In contrast, esg mutant CySCs that give rise to a closely related lineage, the apical hub cells, cannot maintain hub cell identity.  this dual regulatory role is due to simultaneous control by Esg of overlapping genetic programs. Similar results were obtained with intestinal stem cells.
Escargot and Scratch regulate neural commitment by antagonizing Notch activity in Drosophila sensory organs
Esg controls specification of cell types in trachea and suppresses ERK signaling in fusion cells to control cells' differential migratory behavior.

Complex interactions between cis-regulatory modules in native conformation are critical for Drosophila snail expression.
Study shows that Sna represses transcription of pbl in the mesoderm primordium of D. melanogaster via one or more Sna-binding sites, which are conserved among species of the Drosophila genus, but not in the mosquito, correlating with the different modes of gastrulation in the different genuses.
Rapid transcription kinetics and negative autoregulation are responsible for the remarkable homogeneity of snail expression and the coordination of mesoderm invagination.
Snail can potentiate enhancer activation by collaborating with different activators, providing a new mechanism by which Snail regulates development.
evidence for mechanosensitivity of cell-cell junctions and implications that myosin-mediated tension can prevent Snail-driven Eepithelial-mesenchymal transitions
Disruption of Snail expression in follicle stem cells compromises proliferation, but not maintenance. FSCs with excessive Snail expression had increased proliferation and lifespan, accompanied by a moderate decrease inE-cadherin expression (required for adhesion of FSCs to their niche) at the junction between their adjacent cells, indicating a conserved role of Snail in E-cadherin inhibition.
during gastrulation of Drosophila embryos, Sna expression downregulates polarity protein Baz which in turn results in junction disassembly at protein levels.
While either Snail or Serpent induced a profound loss of epithelial polarity and tissue organisation, Serpent but not Snail also induced an increase in the size of wing discs. Furthermore, the Serpent-induced tumour-like tissues were able to grow extensively when transplanted into the abdomen of adult hosts.
Study finds that expression of Snail (Sna) in adult Drosophila intestinal Apc-Ras tumors leads to the formation of macrometastases, which shows remarkable parallels to human metastases and reveals that Snail activates a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in tumor cells and that tumor cells undergo collective cell migration and seed polyclonal metastases.

Dorsal, a Drosophila homolog of NF-kappaB, patterns the dorsal-ventral axis in the blastoderm embryo. During this stage, Dorsal is sequestered outside the nucleus by the IkappaB homolog Cactus. Dorsal accumulates on the ventral side of the syncytial blastoderm. We use modeling and experimental studies to show that this accumulation is caused by facilitated diffusion, or shuttling, of the Dorsal/Cactus complex.

the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a cis-acting RNA localisation signal promotes the interaction of Egl with BicD, which licenses the latter protein to recruit dynein and dynactin.

study found the JAK-STAT signaling target & inhibitor, SOCS36E, is required for germline stem cell maintenance; SOCS36E suppresses JAK-STAT signaling specifically in the somatic stem cells, preventing them from displacing neighboring germline stem cells
Socs36E attenuates STAT signaling to optimize motile cell specification in the Drosophila ovary.
The Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway regulator SOCS36E functions via two independent mechanisms.
contributes mechanistic insight to a Jak/STAT regulatory genetic circuit, and suggests that Socs36E regulates Jak/STAT signaling via a Cul2-dependent mechanism, as well as by a Cullin-independent manner, in vivo
Socs36E is node through which these processes are linked, demonstrating that negative feedback inhibition integrates multiple aspects of stem cell behavior.
once sperm storage has initiated, Acp36DE acts as a guidance factor helping subsequent sperm move into storage
Mates of males lacking Acp36DE, which is needed for the accumulation of sperm in the storage organs, fail to complete the full sequence of the conformational changes in the mated female's uterus that occur during and immediately after mating.
Mutations of Acp36DE's cleavage site that slowed or prevented cleavage of the protein slowed the accumulation of sperm into storage, although they did not affect uterine conformational changes in mated females.
changes in intercellular adhesion mediated by the transmembrane protein Fasciclin III (FasIII) represent a key mediator of morphogenesis.

it reports of a novel function of BSF in flies and demonstrates that it has an important intra-mitochondrial role, which is essential for maintaining mtDNA gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation.
Epistasis studies showed that Mbl silencing was sufficient to induce a subcellular redistribution of TBPH and BSF proteins in the muscle, which mimicked the effect of i(CTG)480 expression.
Although the C region of the osk 3' UTR is required for the noncoding function, BSF binding does not appear to be essential for that function.

genetic ablation of Atonal Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) affects antennal lobe structure and axon targeting of Amos ORNs.
Expression of Atac2-RNAi or a dominant negative allele of Atac2 generated more intestinal stem cells(ISCs), while excessive Atac2 or a histone deacetylase inhibitor promoted ISC differentiation without affecting ISC survival or lineage specification.
The roX1 and roX2 genes produce redundant, male-specific lethal transcripts required for targeting the MSL complex.
suggest a model in which male-specific lethal (MSL) proteins assemble into active complexes by binding nascent roX transcripts
spreads from roX genes on the Drosophila X chromosome.
the amino-terminal region of MSL1 binds to hundreds of sites on the X chromosome in normal males but only to approximately 30 high-affinity sites in the absence of endogenous MSL1
majority of the MSL-1 targets are primarily expressed during early embryogenesis and many target genes possess DNA replication element factor (DREF)-binding sites in their promoters
results demonstrate the potent capability of roX genes to organize large chromatin domains in cis, on the X chromosome; found that NURF complex and MSL proteins have opposing effects on roX RNA transcription.
Results suggest that the MSL complex (including MSL-1, -2, and -3) uses high-affinity sites to initially recognize the X chromosome and then associates with many of its targets through sequence-independent features of transcribed genes.
Incorporation of the roX RNAs into the MSL complex alters the binding specificity of the chromatin-binding module formed by the amino-terminal domains of MSL1 and MSL2.
Data suggest that the Y chromosome is likely to act through modulation of a process that is defective in roX1 roX2 mutants: X chromosome recognition or chromatin modification by the MSL complex.
The Msl1-mediated dimerization of the entire MSL complex is required for Msl2 binding, X chromosome recognition, and spreading along the X chromosome.
We show that SPT5 interacts directly with MSL1 in vitro and is required downstream of MSL complex recruitment, providing the first mechanistic data corroborating the elongation model of dosage compensation.
Genetic and biochemical analyses reveal a functional interaction of MSL1 with CDK7, a subunit of the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex of the general transcription factor TFIIH. Importantly, MSL1 depletion leads to decreased phosphorylation of Ser5 of RNA polymerase II.
In Drosophila melanogaster, transcriptional output from the single male X-chromosome is equalized to that of XX females by recruitment of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which increases transcript levels of active genes 2-fold.

Results establish Tailup as being a critical new transcription factor in dorsal vessel morphogenesis and lymph gland formation and place this regulator directly upstream of Hand in these developmental processes.
The data support a model in which the EGFR and Dpp signalling pathways, with their respective downstream Iro-C and tup genes, converge and cooperate to commit cells to the notum developmental fate.
The early expression of Tup in the cardiac mesoderm suggests that Tup functions in cardiac specification.
Tailup is required to activate achaete and scute at the dorsocentral region, probably by acting as an hexameric complex with the cofactor Chip and the transcriptional activator Sspd on the dorsocentral enhancer of the achaete-scute complex.
This study demonistratedt that therole of Islet on the excitability patterns characteristic of motoneuron subtypes.
Tup/Islet1 integrates time and position to specify muscle identity in Drosophila.
Tailup is expressed in the main Drosophila cardiac outflow components, i.e., heart anchoring cells (HANC) and cardiac outflow muscles (COM) and that loss of its function and/or tissue-specific knockdowns dramatically affect cardiac outflow morphogenesis.
These observations provide evidence for combinatorial activity of Isl and Lim3 in regulating ion channel gene expression
An Org-1-Tup transcriptional cascade reveals different types of alary muscles connecting internal organs in Drosophila.

the class III POU protein, Drifter (Ventral veinless), is co-expressed with Islet and Lim3 specifically in the ISNb motoneuron subclass
Molecular variation of the shuttle craft and Lim3 genes, controlling the development of the nervous system, in a natural Drosophila melanogaster population
Polymorphism of Lim3 affects Lim3 transcription and fly lifespan.
These observations provide evidence for combinatorial activity of Isl and Lim3 in regulating ion channel gene expression
we demonstrate that the evolutionary conserved Lim3 core promoter provides basic Lim3 expression, whereas structural changes in the Lim3 PRE of distal promoter provide stage-, and tissue-specific Lim3 expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that PcG/TrxG proteins, which are directly involved in Lim3 transcription regulation, participate in lifespan control.
altered mitochondrial activity is crucial for the decrease of adult lifespan caused by Lim3 knockdown early in life. In adults that encountered Lim3 depletion early in life, the transcription of several genes remained altered, and mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level and locomotion were increased, confirming the existence of carry-over effects.

Data show that the tumor suppressors Brat and Numb regulate transit-amplifying neuroblast lineages in Drosophila.
Brain Tumor (Brat) was identified as a potent differentiation factor and target of Pum-Nos regulation.

Topo II does have some role in mitotic chromatin condensation
Results suggest that displacement of the heterochromatin proteins D1, HP1 and topoisomerase II from satellite III result in stochastic chromatin opening and desilencing of the nearby white gene in white-mottled flies.
Topo II is required to prevent Mod(mdg4)2.2 degradation and, consequently, to stabilize Su(Hw) insulator-mediated chromatin organization
our results suggest that the previously observed discrepancies in the chromosomal phenotypes elicited by Topo II downregulation in vertebrates might depend on slight differences in Topo II concentration and/or activity
These data suggest both that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved in order to complete meiosis.

Dmaf gene is expressed in somatic gonadal cells; results suggest a specific function for Dmaf in gonadal development, including migration and differentiation of primordial germ cells.
role as critical modulator of the adhesive properties of somatic cells, facilitating germline-soma interactions that are essential for germ cell differentiation

Receptor phosphatase Dlar regulates the formation and maintenance of presynaptic proteins.
Functions of the ectodomain and cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine-phosphatase domains of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase Dlar in vivo were studied.
Results suggest that Liprin-alpha does not simply act by regulating receptor tyrosine phosphatase LAR localization but also has LAR-independent functions
During development of the larval mushroom body, Lar is expressed within an expanded core region including somewhat older axons. Lar is necessary for the axonal branching decisions that create the lobes.
Data demonstrate that N-cadherin, DLAR, and Liprin-alpha function in a complex to regulate adhesive interactions between pre- and post-synaptic cells and provide a novel mechanism for controlling the activity of Liprin-alpha in the developing growth cone.
LAR function in R7 is independent of its phosphatase activity, but requires structural features that allow dimerization and may promote the assembly of downstream effectors.
the crystal structures of the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains of the Drosophila type IIa receptor Dlar and its mouse homolog LAR were reported.
Drosophila caskin (ckn) is necessary for embryonic motor axon pathfinding and interacts genetically and physically with the leukocyte common antigen-related
the Lar receptor tyrosine phosphatase appears to polarize and retain GSCs through maintenance of localized E-cadherin-based adherens junctions
The results of this study suggested that loss of Lar alters sLNv axonal targeting in the dorsal protocerebrum during embryonic or early larval development, thereby impairing PDF signaling, synchronization of the circadian network, and rhythmic activity.
Fat2/Lar signaling mediates short-range communication between neighboring cells instead of transmitting long-range information across a tissue.
The authors found that the depth of the final layer of stable photoreceptor axon termination relied primarily on the cumulative amount of LAR and Ptp69D cytoplasmic activity, while specific features of their ectodomains contribute to the choice between two synaptic layers, M3 and M6, in the medulla.
Sema-5c antagonizes the activity of Lar, another transmembrane guidance cue that operates along leading-trailing cell-cell interfaces in this tissue, via a mechanism that appears to be independent of Plexin A.

Data show Drosophila brain expressing short neuropeptide F transcript and short neuropeptide F peptide. Most of these
We have demonstrated here that subsets of Drosophila lateral clock neurons are heterogeneous with respect to expression of neuroactive compounds, including ion transport peptide and short neuropeptide F
These results indicate that sNPF1 and sNPF2 peptides processed from the sNPF precursor are sufficient for regulating body growth through the ERK-insulin pathway in Drosophila.
Different layers of the fan-shaped body sNPFR1
Findings indicate that short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and corazonin (CRZ) co-released from a small set of neurons regulate insulin-producing cells (IPCs) stress resistance and metabolism.
Here we show that a neuropeptide precursor gene encoding four types of short neuropeptide F (sNPF) is required in the Kenyon cells for appetitive olfactory memory.
Loss of function of sNPF and sNPFR1 also elevated sleep.
Light and the neuropeptides PDF and sNPF act dynamically at distinct hubs of the circadian neural circuit to produce multiple suppressive events that create the proper tempo and sequence of circadian pacemaker neuronal activities.
These results provide supportive evidence that sNPF-producing neurons promote long-lasting increases in sleep, and show for the first time that even brief periods of activation of these neurons can cause changes in behavior that persist after cessation of activation.

MOF controls Checkpoint protein2 and regulates genomic stability during early embryogenesis.
We conclude that the primary responsibility for maintaining genome integrity in the male germline lies with Chk2, and that P53 is required to reconstitute the germline when cells are eliminated owing to unrepaired DNA damage.
nuclear retention involves Chk2-mediated inactivation of the Drosophila stem loop binding protein (SLBP), the levels of which are specifically depleted in damaged nuclei following Chk2 phosphorylation, an event that contributes to nuclear fallout.

CG9323 is the true ortholog of the human RHAU/DHX36 DEAH-box RNA helicase. CG9323 possesses guanine quadruplex-RNA binding and resolving activities.
The study provides the first evidence that the unfolding kinetics of a G-quadruplex can be modulated by different nucleotide-bound states of the RHAU helicase (CG9323).
The crystal structures of DHX36 in complex with RNA and DNA, revealing that G-rich tracts are specifically recognized by the helicase. The negatively charged G-quadruplex is recognized and destabilized by a positively charged binding cage and then unfolded via ATP-dependent ssDNA translocation activity. On the basis of these results, a conceptual G4 DNA-resolving mechanism is proposed.
This indicates that in an unexpectedly small set of genes, in which G-quadruplex motifs are unusually common in the 5'-UTR of their mRNAs, Rhau helicase is responsible for the regulation of their expression.

Cdc42 and the formins diaphanous and DAAM play pivotal roles in heart lumen formation through the spatiotemporal regulation of the actomyosin network.
Dia plays two roles during invasive podosome formation at the fusion site: it dictates the level of linear F-actin polymerization, and it is required for appropriate branched actin polymerization via localization of SCAR and WASp.
Using constitutively active Dia constructs, authors provide additional evidence that Dia functions upstream of SCAR activity to regulate actin dynamics at the fusion site and to localize the Abi-SCAR complex.

Data show that removal of p55 deregulated the expression of E2F targets that are normally repressed by dE2F2/RBF-1 and -2 complexes in a cell cycle-independent manner but had no effect on the expression of targets normally coupled with cell proliferation.
examination of linking together the Myb and E2F2 complexes in higher-order assembly to specific chromosomal sites for the regulation of transcription
RBF2 has a unique function in repressing E2F-regulated differentiation markers and dE2F2 and RBF2 are required to regulate different sets of target genes in different tissues

Combined inactivation of dE2F1 and dE2F2 had no significant effect on cell division of Hippo pathway mutant cells.
dE2F2, as well as the net E2F activity, which can be depleted by mutating the common cofactor, dDp, is inhibitory for p53-independent apoptosis.
Heterozygous mutation of mip120 or E2f2 suppressed the binucleate cell phenotype in the peripodial epithelium of Myb-null wing discs.
The dE2F2 protein repress the expression of buffy, the anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and activate the expression of an RNA-binding protein that destabilizes diap1 in Drosophila.

identification of a new component of insulin signalling in Drosophila, the steppke gene (step)
Step may be part of a larger signaling scaffold coordinating receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent MAPK activation
Steppke controls initial plasma membrane furrow ingression during the syncytial nuclear divisions and cellularization of the Drosophila embryo. Acting at the tips of ingressing furrows, Steppke promotes local endocytic events through its Arf-GEF activity.
It is proposed that a global distribution of Step normally sets an inhibitory threshold for Rho1 activity to restrict early cell formation to the posterior.
In Drosophila, protein localization, laser ablation, and genetic interaction studies indicate that the cytohesin Steppke reduces tissue tension by inhibiting actomyosin activity at adherens junctions. Without Steppke, embryogenesis fails, with epidermal distortions and tears resulting from myosin misregulation.
This study is significant for defining a molecular mechanism that recruits Step to myosin-rich junctions for an established role in regulating actomyosin activity at these sites.

Induces eye specification, at least in part, by allowing the activation of eye specification genes by the wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) signaling pathways.
Nub and Tsh domains share some of the attributes of classical compartments, but lack their stringent and immobile boundaries.
Data show that tio (tiptop) and tsh (teashirt) have coincident expression domains in the imaginal discs, the precursors of the adult body, and that both genes show similar functional properties when expressed ectopically.
Data demonstrate that ectopic eye formation by teashirt and its paralog tiptop, a potential new eye specification gene, is restricted to the developing antennae.
Tsh contains three zinc finger motifs the second zinc finger is essential to the proper functioning of the protein while the remaining zinc finger domains appear to contribute but are not absolutely required
Tiptop/teashirt genes regulate cell differentiation and renal physiology in Drosophila.
studies demonstrate a novel neuroprotective function of tsh and its paralog tio in Abeta42 mediated neurodegeneration
Hth+Tsh-induced tissue overgrowth requires the BMP2 Dpp and the abnormal hyperactivation of its pathway. Rather than using autocrine Dpp expression, Hth+Tsh cells increase their avidity for Dpp, produced locally, by upregulating extracellular matrix components.
Rather than directly regulating cell cycle genes, hth and tsh control cell proliferation through an intermediary layer of nuclear receptors of the ecdysone/estrogen-signaling pathway.

hese are explained by physical interaction between MSL2 and CLAMP. In vivo, both factors cooperate to compete with nucleosome formation at HAS. The male-specific MSL2 thus synergises with a ubiquitous GA-repeat binding protein for refined X/autosome discrimination
proper MSL2 positioning requires an interaction with either CLAMP or DNA to initiate dosage compensation in Drosophila males.

Results identify the serine protease homologue-encoding gene scaf as a new transcriptional target of JNK signalling and reveal the first secreted regulator of the JNK pathway acting in a negative-feedback loop during epithelial morphogenesis.
Here we uncover a cell non-autonomous requirement for the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway in the lateral epidermis for sustained dpp expression in the LE. Specifically, we demonstrate that Egfr pathway activity in the lateral epidermis prevents expression of the gene scarface (scaf), encoding a secreted antagonist of JNK signaling
scaf promotes feeding in response to the presence of sugar in the food, therefore providing a mechanism for the regulation of hedonic feeding.

Significantly, the JNK pathway is responsible for the majority of the phenotypes and transcriptional changes downstream of Notch-Src synergy.
Src overexpression alone activated the Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signalling pathway to promote actin cytoskeletal and cell polarity defects and drive apoptosis in in a whole epithelial tissue context in the Drosophila eye, whereas, in cooperation with RasACT, JNK led to a loss of differentiation and an invasive phenotype.

the Dscam repertoire of each cell is different from those of its neighbors, providing a potential mechanism for generating unique cell identity in the nervous system and elsewhere.
These results suggest that exon 17.1 is minimally involved in axonal morphogenesis and that morphogenesis of MB axons probably involves multiple distinct exon 17.2-containing Dscam isoforms.
We propose that different extracellular domains of Dscam share a common function and that differences in isoforms expressed on the surface of neighboring axons influence interactions between them.

Data show that the Costal2-Fused-Cubitus interruptus (Cos2-Fu-Ci) protein complex is associated with Smoothened (Smo) in membrane fractions, and that Cos2 binding on Smo is necessary for the Hedgehog-dependent dissociation of Ci from this complex.
Data show that a positive response of Costal2 to Hedgehog stimulation requires a portion of the Smoothened cytoplasmic tail and the Costal2 cargo domain, which interacts directly with Smoothened.
Costal2 associates with membranes in a Hedgehog-sensitive, Smoothened-independent manner
Cos2 recruits multiple kinases to efficiently phosphorylate Cubitus interruptus.
Differential Hh target gene regulation can be accomplished by differential sensitivity of Cos2 and Su(Fu) to Hh.
Data suggest that, after activation of Smoothened, the Fused kinase induces a conformational change in Costal2 that allows the disassembly of the Smo-Fu-Cos2-Cubitus interruptus complex and consequent activation of Hedgehog target genes.
Cos2 motility plays an important role in its function, regulating the amounts and activity of Ci that ultimately interpret the level of Hh to which cells are exposed.

The CORD region of Ci has a second function distinct from Cos2 binding that inhibits Ci processing. Cos2 binding to CORD relieves this inhibition.

Data show Ci interaction with Su(fu) or Cos2 correlates with Su(fu)- or Cos2-mediated suppression of Ci activity
We identified Ubr3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel, positive regulator of Hh signaling in Drosophila and vertebrates. Hh signaling regulates the Ubr3-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation of Cos2, a central component of Hh signaling. In developing Drosophila eye discs, loss of ubr3 leads to a delayed differentiation of photoreceptors and a reduction in Hh signaling.
Cos2 is sumoylated, which counteracts its inhibitory role on Smo accumulation in the wing.
Evolutionarily selected sequence differences enable immotile Cos2 motors to function not as transporters but as microtubule-based tethers of signaling complexes.

atonal expression in Drosophila retinal progenitors involves redundant and synergistic contributions of Ey/Pax6 and So binding sites within two distant enhancers
mapping of So-enriched regions throughout the genome in third instar larval eye discs; study found 7,566 So-enriched regions, which map to approximately 5,952 genes, including previously characterized So targets in the eye
By removing gene function in differentiating cells, the study shows that so is dispensable for larval photoreceptor differentiation, but is required for differentiation during pupal development.
Uncover a novel role for Eya and So in promoting cell cycle exit in the retinal second mitotic wave (SMW), a synchronized, terminal cell division that occurs several hours after passage of the furrow. We show that Combgap (Cg), a zinc-finger transcription factor, antagonizes Eya-So function in the SMW.

the mechanical properties of coiled-coil regions of myosin v
data indicate that myosin V and VI, but not II, play related but distinct roles in regulating microtubule (MT)-based mitochondrial movement: they oppose, rather than complement, protracted MT-based movements and perhaps facilitate organelle docking
Patronin and Shot then act to polarise microtubules along the apical-basal axis to enable apical transport of Rab11 endosomes by the Nuf-Dynein microtubule motor complex. Finally, Rab11 endosomes are transferred to the MyoV (also known as Didum in Drosophila) actin motor to deliver the key microvillar determinant Cadherin 99C to the apical membrane to organise the biogenesis of actin microvilli.
Competition between kinesin-1 and myosin-V defines Drosophila posterior determination.

we show that the transition from the actomyosin contractile ring to the midbody ring proceeds via a previously uncharacterized maturation process that requires opposing mechanisms of removal and retention of the scaffold protein Anillin.
p62 plays a protective role against polyQ-induced neurodegeneration, by the autophagic degradation of polyQ protein oligomers in vivo
Traumatic brain injury leads to ubiquitinated p62 stress granules in frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Drosophila model.
A very large binding cooperativity is identified, unique to stemloop IV in U2A snRNP/RNA complexes.
U2A' immobilizes SNF and RNA residues to restore U2 stem-loop IV binding affinity, while U1 stem-loop II binding does not require such adjustments. Study findings show how U2A' can modulate RNA specificity of SNF without changing SNF conformation or relying on direct RNA contacts.
During embryogenesis, the activated Torso receptor tyrosine kinase (TOR RTK) pathway activates tailless (tll) expression by a relief-of-repression mechanism.
STAT, encoded by marelle (mrl; DStat92E), is essential for the gain-of-function mutant Tor (Tor(GOF)) to activate ectopic gene expression
Data show that in Drosophila, the receptor tyrosine kinase Torso activates both STAT92E and Ras1 during the early phase of primordial germ cell development.
the Torso RTK pathway has a role in downregulation of Capicua repression and tailless activation in the Drosophila embryo
A specific feature of Torso pathway signaling is the fact that the cell-cell contact at the origin of the triggering mechanism is established much earlier than the signaling mechanism itself.
lack of pgc partly ameliorates the cellularization defect of tor mutants, thus revealing a functional antagonism between pgc and tor in the specification of germline and somatic properties.
study demonstrates that Torso, is the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) receptor; study concludes that PTTH initiates metamorphosis by activation of the Torso/ERK pathway
down-regulates Capicua at the embryonic termini
closca is a gene encoding a new member of a group of proteins that act non-redundantly in vitelline membrane biogenesis and in Torso signalling; Nasrat protein is another member of this group incorporated into the vitelline membrane
characterized a new psq loss-of-function allele, psq(rum), which specifically affects signaling by the Torso (Tor) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
The Torso RTK is required for proper migration of primordial germ cells in Drosophila.
Torso reduces the stability of Capicua by controlling the rates of its nucleocytoplasmic transport
repeated Torso activation is linked to a duplication and differential expression of a ligand-encoding gene, the acquisition of distinct enhancers in the torso-like promoter and the recruitment of proteins independently required for embryogenesis
Data indicate that Torso-like (Tsl) and receptor tyrosine kinase Torso (Tor) have opposing effects on body size.
The conserved Tor metabolic sensing pathway regulates yolk catabolism.
Data suggest that Tor signaling governs Yki (Yorkie protein) action after reaching nucleus by allowing access to target genes via Hpo (Hippo protein) pathway; Tor also promotes wing growth by liberating Yki from nuclear seclusion.
Our study revealed a novel role for Torso in the fat body with respect to regulation of insulin/TOR signaling and body size.
Torso interacts with both Trunk and Torso-like, which cooperate to mediate dimerization and activation of Torso at the ends of the Drosophila embryo
CRL3(GCL) promotes primordial germ cell fate by mediating degradation of Torso, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and major determinant of somatic cell fate.
Mechanistically, the authors identify foxo and mTOR homologue, Tor as important regulators of germline stem cells quiescence following exposure to ionizing radiation. foxo is required for entry in quiescence, while Tor is essential for cell cycle reentry.
Cic functions are independent of RTK regulation and may depend on cofactor-assisted DNA binding.
The Torso system has gained relevance in its implications in many biological processes as morphogenesis and into many disciplines such as oncogenesis, hormone control and neurobiology. [review]

TGF-beta type I receptor saxophone is essential for the normal structural and functional development of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, a synapse that displays activity-dependent plasticity.
ALK1 and ALK2 facilitate Bmp signaling, but when alone, ALK1 and ALK2 fail to signal effectively and sequester Gbb
Smox acts downstream of Sax to prevent spermatogonial over-proliferation in Drosophila.
Dad inhibited Saxophone and Thickveins but not Baboon.
Data show different functional requirements for the Sax receptor, and provide a mechanistic framework for future investigations into disease states that arise from defects in BMP/TGF-beta signaling.

These results suggest a function of HP1a in transcription facilitating H3K36 demethylation at transcribed and/or heterochromatin regions by dKDM4A (CG15835).
these results have implications for the role of the epigenetic regulator Dmel\Kdm4A in the control of genes involved in life span and male-specific sex determination in the fly.
binding to HP1a is required for dKDM4A-mediated H3K36me3 demethylation at a subset of heterochromatic genes. Collectively, these results show that HP1a functions to target the H3K36 demethylase dKDM4A to heterochromatic genes in Drosophila
Appropriate expression levels for some dKDM4A-regulated genes rely on the demethylase activity of dKDM4A, whereas others do not.
Jra recruits the HP1a/KDM4A complex to its gene body region upon osmotic stress to reduce H3K36 methylation levels and disrupt H3K36 methylation-dependent histone deacetylation
dKDM4A, in addition to its previously characterized role in euchromatin, utilizes both enzymatic and structural mechanisms to regulate heterochromatin organization and functions.
the temporal kinetics and pathway utilization during heterochromatic DSB repair depend on dKDM4A-dependent demethylation of heterochromatic histone marks
addition of FAT10 also led to an increased interaction between OTUB1 and its cognate E2 UbcH5B, implying a function of FAT10 in the inhibition of polyubiquitylation
cleavage is catalysed by Drosha, a nuclease of the RNase III family, which acts on primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) in the nucleus
A genome-wide analysis of mRNAs regulated by drosha was performed.
Excess Drosha cleaves pasha/DGCR8 primary transcripts and leads to a reduction in pasha/DGCR8 mRNA levels and Pasha/DGCR8 synthesis.
report clear phenotypic differences between drosha and pasha/dgcr8 null alleles in two postembryonic lineages in the Drosophila brain
We propose that Drosha represents a unique and conserved arm of the cellular defenses used to combat virus infection.
Drosha and Pasha are required for coordinated development of somatic and germ cell precursors in the larval ovary. Loss of Drosha or Pasha function perturbs somatic precursor development, causing defects in formation of terminal filaments.  Drosha-controlled miRNAs including miR-8, miR-14, miR-33, miR-184, miR-317 and let-7-C function in gonadogenesis.

Spenito, a small Spen family member, counteracted Spen function in fat regulation. Finally, mouse Spen and Spenito transcript levels scaled directly with body fat in vivo, suggesting a conserved role in fat liberation and catabolism. This study demonstrates that Spen is a key regulator of energy balance and provides a molecular context to understand the metabolic defects that arise from Spen dysfunction.
COP9 signalosome subunits 4 and 5 regulate multiple pleiotropic pathways in Drosophila melanogaster.
we link the CSN to the degradation of Cyclin E, which promotes the G1-S transition in the cell cycle and then is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
the CSN4 subunit of the COP9 signalosome co-occupies retinoblastoma target gene promoters with Rbf2
downregulation of CSN4 in Arabidopsis and in tobacco cells leads to delayed G1/S transition comparable to that observed when TCTP is downregulated. Loss-of-function of AtTCTP leads to increased fraction of deneddylated CUL1, suggesting that AtTCTP interferes negatively with COP9 function. Similar defects in cell proliferation and CUL1 neddylation status were observed in Drosophila knockdown for dCSN4 or dTCTP
ACC disruption in the oenocytes through RNA-interference induces lethality, as does oenocyte ablation.. this lethality is associated with a failure in the watertightness of the spiracles-the organs controlling the entry of air into the trachea.
Like mio, seh1 has a crucial germline function during oogenesis. In both mio and seh1 mutant ovaries, a fraction of oocytes fail to maintain the meiotic cycle and develop as pseudo-nurse cells.
Hey is primarily expressed in a subset of newly born neurons, which receive Notch signalling during their birth.
Indeed, aging phenotypes were suppressed by continued expression of Hey in enterocytes, suggesting that a Hey-lamin network safeguards nuclear organization and differentiated cell identity.

Results support a model in which conformational differences in proximal sequence element binding protein (DmPBP)-DNA complexes lead to selective RNA polymerase recruitment to U1 and U6 promoters.
Data suggests that the non-conserved region of DmSNAP50 (residues 1-109) makes little if any contribution toward forming a complex with DmSNAP190 and DmSNAP43.
Data help to establish the orientation of each SNAPc subunit on DNA and reveal cases in which different domains of the subunits SNAP43, 50, and 190 differentially contact the U1 versus U6 proximal sequence elements A.
Bdp1 recruitment requires that DmSNAPc be bound to a U6 PSE rather than a U1 PSE. This is consistent with the concept that DmSNAPc adopts different conformations on U6 and U1 PSEs, which lead to the subsequent recruitment of distinct general transcription factors and RNA polymerases for U6 and U1 gene transcription.

Dpn is a partner and target of CK2, and raises the possibility that its repressor functions might also be regulated by phosphorylation.
Groucho and associated maternal and zygotic bHLH repressors define the threshold X-linked signal element gene concentrations needed to activate Sex-lethal establishment promoter and they participate directly in sex signal amplification.
In addition to dpn, Notch signaling must be regulating other genes during this process that act redundantly with dpn.
E(spl) and Dpn act together to maintain the neuroblasts in a self-renewing state, a process in which they are assisted by Notch, which sustains expression of the E(spl) subset
Data suggest that Dpn plays important roles in maintaining NB self-renewal and specification of type II NBs in larval brains and that Dpn and Notch function independently in regulating type II NB proliferation and specification.
Dpn contributes to the establishment of Cut expression.
N activity is required to promote dpn transcription; only in R7 photoreceptor precursors does the removal of Ttk coincide with high N activity; and only in this cell does Dpn expression result

These results provide insight into head morphogenesis and reveal an unexpected positive role for Ptc-Smo signaling in promoting cell proliferation.
hedgehog (Hh) promotes the entry of Sxl into the nucleus in the wing disc; in the anterior compartment, Patched (Ptc) is required for this effect, revealing Ptc as a positive effector of Hh
finding suggests that dominant-negative function can be conferred by interruption of different aspects of Patched protein behaviour
Patched (Ptc), the Hh receptor, restrains both Hedgehog spreading and Hedgehog signaling.
results support a model in which the ratio of bound to unbound Ptc molecules determines the cellular response to Hedgehog
the Hh/Ptc complex is internalized in the Rab7-enriched lysosomal compartment in a Ptc-dependent manner without the co-receptor Smoothened (Smo).
The role of Patched (Ptc) in regulating the guidance of medial tract, one of the longitudinal tracts in the nerve cord, is investigated.
the upstream part of the Hedgehog pathway involving Hedgehog interaction with Patched, regulation of Smoothened by Patched, and Smoothened enrichment at the plasma membrane is highly conserved between Drosophila and humans
Ptc, as well as truncated Ptc deleted of its C-terminal domain, forms a stable trimer. This observation is consistent with the proposal that Ptc is structurally similar to trimeric transporters.
lipophorins internalization does not play a major role in Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction but does in Hh gradient formation
Self-induced patched receptor down-regulation modulates cell sensitivity to the hedgehog morphogen gradient.

in vivo study demonstrates that the PI3K-cIII complex is essential for downregulating Patched via the endosomal-lysosomal pathway to execute axon pruning
a mutation of the PTC PY motif, which mediates binding of C2-WW-HECT family members, inhibits its internalization but not its autonomous and non-autonomous signalling activities. the two related UB-C2-WW-HECT ligases NEDD4 and SU(DX) regulate PTC trafficking and finely tune its accumulation through partially redundant but distinct functions

Drosophila Ana2 is a conserved centriole duplication factor.
DSas-6 and Ana2 normally cooperate to drive the formation of the centriole inner cartwheel and they promote both centriole duplication and centriole cohesion in a Sak/Plk4-dependent manner.
these findings reveal that the centrosomal proteins Ana2 and Ctp regulate Mud function to orient the mitotic spindle during neuroblasts asymmetric division.
Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle static light scattering demonstrates that LC8 dimers bind Ana2M sites and induce Ana2 tetramerization, yielding an Ana2M4-LC88 complex.
Thus, efficient centriole duplication in flies requires the homo-oligomerisation of both Sas-6 and Ana2.
Two-step phosphorylation of Ana2 by Plk4 is required for Ana2 recruitment to the centriole.
Plk4 first phosphorylates the extreme N terminus of Ana2, which is critical for subsequent STAN domain modification. Phosphorylation of the central region then breaks the Plk4-Ana2 interaction. This phosphorylation pattern is important for centriole assembly and integrity.

Data indicate that Kermit interacts with Go and another PCP component Vang during planar cell polarity (PCP).
Vang phosphorylation occurs on conserved N-terminal serine/threonine residues, is mediated by CK1epsilon/Dco, and is critical for polarized membrane localization of Vang and other PCP proteins.
The transmembrane proteins Frizzled and Flamingo form a stoichiometric nucleus in the complex, while the relative levels of the other four core proteins can vary independently.we show that robust cell polarization is achieved over a range of complex stoichiometries but is dependent on maintaining appropriate levels of the components Frizzled and Strabismus.
The authors conclude that Casein Kinase Iepsilon phosphorylation acts as a switch, promoting Strabismus mobility and Dishevelled immobility, thus enhancing sorting of these proteins to opposite cell edges.
Report finds that Vang protein is required for the rotation of the DA1/VA1d dendritic pair. Vang functions in the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), suggesting a codependence of ORN axonal and projection neuron (PN) dendritic targeting.

propose that dMyD88 is the functional homolog of TIRAP and that both proteins function as sorting adaptors to recruit downstream signaling adaptors to activated receptors
a novel function of MyD88 in the regulation of metabolism that appears to be independent of its known roles in immunity and development.
there are marked differences in biochemical activity between fly Wun and mammalian lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPPs), with Wun having a narrower activity range than has been reported for the mammalian LPPs
Drosophila melanogaster lipid phosphate phosphatases Wunen and Wunen 2 have roles in lateral migration and germ cell elimination
germ cell survival and directionality of migration are controlled by two lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP), wunen (wun) and wunen-2 (wun2). wun wun2 double mutant analysis reveals that the two genes act redundantly in primordial germ cells.
The germ cell migratory path can be primarily accounted for by Wunen expression.

Mutation of the Srpk79D gene causes conspicuous accumulations of BRP in larval and adult nerves.
Review describes how genetic elimination of Bruchpilot revealed that the protein is essential for T-bar formation, calcium channel clustering, and hence proper vesicle fusion and patterned synaptic plasticity.
Bruchpilot, a ubiquitous presynaptic active zone protein, is required for anesthesia-resistant olfactory memory.
This study found a circadian rhythm of BRP expression in the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the optic lobe and in the brain of D. melanogaster. In LD 12:12 the rhythm of BRP abundance is bimodal, displaying morning (ZT1) and evening (ZT13) peaks
The macromolecular architecture created by the alternating pattern of the Bruchpilot isoforms determines the number of Ca(2+) channel-coupled SV release slots available per AZ and thereby sets the size of the RRP.
CK2alpha is a novel regulator of the active zone protein, BRP, in Drosophila.
The presynaptic protein Brp promotes evoked transmission and suppresses spontaneous release.
The precise nanoscopic organization of Brp distinguishes different physiological active zones (AZs) and links functional diversification to a heretofore unrecognized neuronal gradient of the AZ cytomatrix ultrastructure.
Consistent with a block in axonal transport, we find a decrease in number of active zones and reduced neurotransmission in flies overexpressing Par-1 kinase. Interestingly, we find that Par-1 acts independently of Tau-one of the most well studied substrates of Par-1, revealing a presynaptic function for Par-1 that is independent of Tau

Drosophila MMP2 regulates the matrix molecule faulty attraction (Frac) to promote motor axon targeting in Drosophila.
Matrix metalloproteinase 2 is required for fat-body remodeling in Drosophila
As a Wnt signaling antagonist, MMP2 cleaves the glypican, reducing the ability of Dlp to interact with the Wnt ligand and promote its distribution.
Finally, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), a type of protease thought to facilitate mammalian ovulation, is expressed in mature follicle and corpus luteum cells.
We also show that follicular OA-Oamb signaling induces Mmp2 enzymatic activation but not Mmp2 protein expression, likely via intracellular Ca2+ as the second messenger.
Data indicate that matrix metalloproteinases mmp1 and mmp2 mutants have distinct heart phenotypes.
there are only two MMP genes in Drosophila, DmMmp1 and DmMmp2, which makes Drosophila an attractive system to analyze the basis of MMP specificity. Previously, Drosophila MMPs have been categorized by their pericellular localization, as Mmp1 appeared to be secreted and Mmp2 appeared to be membrane-anchored, suggesting that protein localization was the critical distinction in this small MMP family
inhibition of ECM degradation by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2) to preserve the extracellular environment characteristics of young adults led to increased dendrite regeneration

loss of CUL4 in Drosophila cells causes G(1) cell cycle arrest and an increased protein level of the CDK inhibitor Dacapo
The expression of Dap was found to be controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling-regulated transcription factor Pointed (Pnt) and the proneural basic helix-loop-helix proteins Atonal (Ato) and Daughterless (Da).
The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Dacapo promotes replication licensing during Drosophila endocycles.
Dap influences the timing of the mitotic/meiotic transition.

a light-dependent switch in the phosphorylation pattern of the TRPL channel mediates stable expression of TRPL in the rhabdomeres upon prolonged dark-adaptation.
TRP and TRPL assemble exclusively as homomultimeric channels in their native environment.
The transient receptor potential-like (TRPL) cation channel is a direct target for camphor in gustatory receptor neurons; long-term feeding on a camphor diet leads to reversible downregulation of TRPL protein concentrations.

These studies provide a molecular analysis for the functional requirement of Orc6 in replicative functions of ORC in Drosophila and suggest that Orc6 may contribute to the sequence preferences of ORC in targeting to the origins.
These results show that the interaction of Orc6 with the septin complex is dependent on the coiled-coil domain of Pnut, and suggest an active role for Orc6 in septin complex function.
In a cross-species complementation experiment, the expression of human Orc6 in Drosophila Orc6 mutant cells rescued DNA replication, suggesting that this function of the protein is conserved among metazoans.
Drosophila Orc6 protein, the smallest subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), directly binds to septin complex and facilitates septin filament formation.

Mef2 transmits circadian clock information in neuronal plasticity, which contributes to locomotor activity rhythms.
The loss of phosphorylated MEF2 contributes to loss of anabolic enzyme expression in Gram-negative bacterial infection. MEF2 is thus a critical transcriptional switch in the adult fat body between metabolism and immunity.
Our results show that Mef2 and possibly Sd regulate a Dl enhancer specifically expressed in the developing indirect flight muscles and that Mef2 is required for Dl expression in developing indirect flight muscles.
critical switch between anabolic and immune function in the adult Drosophila fat body [review]
MEF2 directly controls fusion at multiple stages of the life cycle
Overexpression of Tinman and Pannier resulted in 20% of embryos with ectopic Hand and Sur expression. By adding MEF2 alongside Tinman and Pannier, an expansion in expression of Hand and Sur was observed.
The authors show that loss of frataxin homolog (fh) in Drosophila leads to iron toxicity, which in turn induces sphingolipid synthesis and ectopically activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2).
CF2 expression variations yield altered Mef2 expression levels but with correct spatio-temporal Mef2 expression patterns, it can be concluded that only the mechanism controlling expression levels is de-regulated. Here, it is proposed that CF2 regulates Mef2 expression through a Feedforward Loop circuit.

role in triggering janus kinase-dependent apoptosis
Eiger and Wengen represent proximal components of an evolutionarily conserved TNF-like signaling pathway in Drosophila.
Crystal cell rupture after injury in Drosophila requires egr.
eiger activates the cellular immune response of the fly to aid clearance of extracellular pathogens; intracellular pathogens, which can already defeat professional phagocytes, are unaffected by eiger
Soluble processed forms of Eiger, if produced at all in the fly, are unlikely mediators of cell death and that the membrane-proximal portion of Eiger may contain a novel functional domain not previously described within the TNF family.

such Egr-induced necrosis depends on the catalytic activity of the initiator caspase Dronc and the input from JNK signaling but is independent of their roles in apoptosis.

Residues in two homology blocks on the amino side of the tRNase Z His domain contribute unexpectedly to pre-tRNA 3' end processing
The study shows that dRNaseZ is necessary for 3'-end processing of nuclear & mitochondrial tRNAs. In mitotically growing imaginal discs it is required for cell proliferation and/or viability. In endoreplicating salivary glands, it controls organ size.
RNase Z(L) activity is essential for all phases of fly development that involve cell division, including growth of adult tissue progenitors during larval and metamorphic stages, and gametogenesis in adults.
The study implicates Drosophila RNase Z(L) in a novel retrograde signaling pathway initiated by the damage in mitochondria and manifested in a cell cycle delay before the mitotic entry.
The linker region was explored by Ala-scanning through two conserved regions of D. melanogaster tRNase Z: NdomTprox, located at the carboxy end of the amino domain proximal to the linker, and Tflex, a flexible site in the linker. Periodic substitutions in a hydrophobic patch (F329 and L332) at the carboxy end of NdomTprox show 2,700 and 670-fold impairment relative to wild type
Study show that in the Drosophila, Ndg is dispensable for basement membrane assembly and preservation in many tissues, but absolutely required in others.

Two RanBPM isoforms are produced from alternatively spliced transcripts, the longer of which is specifically enriched in the germ stem cell (GSC) niche, a cluster of somatic cells that anchors GSCs and expresses signals that maintain GSC fate.

The roles for Galpha(o) subunit (Go) in mediating the two distinct pathways transduced by Fz receptors in Drosophila.
Study shows that G-oalpha47A and Gbeta13F cooperate with Ggamma1 to maintain cardiac integrity in Drosophila.
Go is required for maximal physiological responses to multiple odorants in Drosophila, and olfactory receptor channel function and G-protein signaling are required for odor responsiveness.
Galphao47A is required in bitter-sensitive taste neurons for L-canavanine sensitivity.
Data indicate that Kermit interacts with Go and another PCP component Vang during planar cell polarity (PCP).
The heterotrimeric G protein Go functions as a transducer of Wingless-Frizzled 2 signaling in the synapse and Ankyrin 2 as a target of Go signaling required for neuromuscular junction formation.
We have taken advantage of this approach to stabilize protein G alpha-go from Drosophila melanogaster. The designed SS-bridge increased by 4 degrees the melting temperature of one domain of protein G alpha-go .
Inhibition of Notch signaling by the p105 and p180 subunits of Drosophila chromatin assembly factor 1 is required for follicle cell proliferation.

Drosophila translin exhibits a stable dimeric state that assembles into a suboctameric (tetramer/hexamer) form and fails to bind ssDNA and RNA targets
A translin null mutant was generated and a trax nonsense mutation was isolated.  Translin is essential for stabilizing its interaction with trax.
Drosophila translin may have roles in neuronal development and behavior analogous to that of mouse translin.
Results suggest that the oligomeric status of translin critically influences the DNA binding properties of translin proteins.
an RNAi regulator that we term C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC), a complex of Translin and Trax was purified; C3PO is a Mg2+-dependent endoribonuclease that promotes RISC activation by removing siRNA passenger strand cleavage products
These studies establish that Trax adopts the translin fold, possesses catalytic centers essential for C3PO's endoRNase activity and interacts extensively with translin to form an octameric assembly.
Study describes the identification of translin (trsn), a highly conserved RNA/DNA binding protein, as essential for starvation-induced sleep suppression. Strikingly, trsn does not appear to regulate energy stores, free glucose levels, or feeding behavior suggesting the sleep phenotype of trsn mutant flies is not a consequence of general metabolic dysfunction or blunted response to starvation.
Findings indicate that the loss of Translin/TRAX complex (dmC3PO) promoted the accumulation of the passenger strand of esi-2.1 (hp-CG4068B) and increased the accumulation of miR-bantam.
it has been shown that translin is upregulated under starvation conditions in Drosophila and is involved in the integration of sleep and metabolic rate of the flies.

The atypical cadherin Flamingo (Fmi) plays critical, but distinct, roles in distinct fate specification of photoreceptors R3 and R4.
Flamingo plays a role in early neuronal differentiation and exerts specific effects on dendrites and axons
Autonomously required for the establishment of ommatidial polarity.
Flamingo occurs in retinal growth cones. Loss of Flamingo function in retinal cells disrupts the local pattern of synaptic terminals in the medulla; Flamingo is transiently expressed in retinal axons as they enter the target region.
Flamingo expresses two differentially spliced RNAs in wing imaginal discs, which encode two isoforms of the atypical cadherin Flamingo.
Atypical cadherin Flamingo functions as a short-range, homophilic signal, passing between specific R cell growth cones to influence postsynaptic targeting.
Study provides evidence that Fmi functions instructively to mediate Fz-Vang intercellular signal relay, recruiting Fz and Vang to opposite sides of cell boundaries.
Flamingo protein binds preferentially to the Fz:Dsh complex and controls asymmetric localization of polarity proteins in pupal wing cells.
Results suggest that Flamingo mediates an interaction between sensory neuron growth cones and intermediate targets, which is required for continued axon advance.
Co-endocytosis of Ed and Fmi provides a link between apicobasal polarity and planar cell polarity.
Data suggest that Gogo acts as a functional partner of Fmi for R8 photoreceptor axon targeting and that the dynamic regulation of their interaction specifies synaptic-layer selection of photoreceptors.
The planar cell polarity gene prickle interacts with flamingo in regulating sensory axon advance at a key choice point - the transition between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system.
Espinas (Esn), binds to an intracellular juxtamembrane domain of Flamingo (Fmi), and that this Fmi-Esn interplay elicits repulsion between dendritic branches of Drosophila sensory neurons
In the SMC3 mutant cells, Fmi appeared to be upregulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism(s), and this elevation of Fmi was at least one cause of the planar cell polarity defect.
We deduce that each cell has a mechanism to estimate and compare the numbers of asymmetric bridges, made between Stan and Stan plus Fz, that link it with its neighbouring cells.
Study demonstrates that the classical cadherin, N-cadherin, and an atypical cadherin, Flamingo, act redundantly to instruct the targeting choices made by every photoreceptor axon.
Contact-mediated cell adhesion via Fmi acts in addition to the Net/Fra guidance system during axon pathfinding across the midline, underlining the importance of PCP molecules during vertebrates and invertebrates midline development.
microRNA-9a regulates dendrite growth through cadherin protein Flamingo-G protein Galphaq signaling in Drosophila sensory neurons
Fmi and Gogo function downstream of Otd in retina.
The transmembrane proteins Frizzled and Flamingo form a stoichiometric nucleus in the complex, while the relative levels of the other four core proteins can vary independently.we show that robust cell polarization is achieved over a range of complex stoichiometries but is dependent on maintaining appropriate levels of the components Frizzled and Strabismus.
Fmi and neuronal activity interact to regulate fine-scale topography.

Together with Egg, Wde (Windei) localizes to euchromatin, is enriched on chromosome 4, and binds to the Painting of fourth (POF) protein.
Windei and H3K9me3 have already been reported in follicular cells of D. melanogaster, but this is the first time that the function of these modifications has been demonstrated in the said cells.
In ovarian somatic cells, Egg is monoubiquitinated and phosphorylated but only monoubiquitination is required for piRNA-mediated transposon repression. Egg monoubiquitination occurs in the nucleus. Egg has its own nuclear localization signal, and the nuclear import of Egg is Wde-independent. Wde recruits Egg to the chromatin at target gene silencing loci, but their interaction is monoubiquitin-independent.

Data suggests that engrailed folds to its native structure via an intermediate in which the HTH motif is formed, and that secondary structure development occurs first followed by tertiary packing.
Anterior crossvein formation requires En function. An extracellular pool of En protein is present in the wing disc that diffuses beyond its expression domain and is required for the formation of the anterior crossvein.

results unveil a link between Cuff activity, heterochromatin assembly and piRNA cluster expression, which is critical for stem-cell and germ-cell development in Drosophila
Analysis of piRNA clusters in the Drosophila ovary shows that hallmarks of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription are fundamentally different at uni-strand versus dual-strand clusters. Genome-wide, piRNA production from dual-strand clusters requires the RDC complex consisting of Rhi, Deadlock (Del), and Cuff.

results show that DDT-R, a gene conferring resistance to DDT, is associated with overtranscription of a single cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1
Data show that Cyp6g1 itself may not have to be overexpressed for DDT resistance to occur.

the role of an uncharacterized protein in Drosophila, salto/CG13164, involved in nuclear shaping and spermatid individualization, is described.
In the absence of functional Garz protein, the integrity of the Golgi complex is impaired and as a result, both vesicle transport of cargo proteins and directed apical membrane delivery are severely disrupted.
garz interacts genetically with the ARF1 homolog ARF79F and with the ARF1-GAP homolog Gap69C, thus placing garz in a regulatory circuit that controls coatomer protein complex I trafficking in Drosophila.
A miRNA screen procedure identifies garz as an essential factor in adult glia functions and validates Drosophila as a beneficial 3Rs model to study glial functions and GBF1 biology.

Frazzled and Robo work as guidance molecules not only for axons but also for dendrites as they navigate within the CNS
Engrailed's function during the segregation of the neuroblasts is crucial for regulating different actors that are later involved in axon guidance
the P3 motif of Frazzled appears to initiate Rho and Abl dependent signals to directly or indirectly regulate myosin II activity in CNS growth cones
fra mutant embryos exhibit guidance defects in a specific subset of commissural axons and these defects can be rescued cell-autonomously by expressing wild-type Fra exclusively in these neurons.
Collectively, these data demonstrate the critical nature of both the P1 and the P3-motifs to Frazzled function in vivo during axon pathway formation.
findings show that the Fra receptor has two genetically separable functions in regulating midline guidance; Fra mediates canonical chemoattraction in response to netrin & it functions independently of netrin to activate commissureless transcription
the midline signalling systems Slit/Robo and Netrin/Frazzled are the main molecular mechanisms that underlie dendritic targeting with respect to the midline.
the medio-lateral positioning of motoneuron dendrites in the leg neuropil is controlled by the midline signalling systems Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra.

Loss of frazzled function results in loss of comm2 expression.
In peripodial cells Frazzled is endocytosed, and undergoes NetA-dependent degradation, which is required for eversion.
Contact-mediated cell adhesion via Fmi acts in addition to the Net/Fra guidance system during axon pathfinding across the midline, underlining the importance of PCP molecules during vertebrates and invertebrates midline development.
Frazzled was found to have a role as a transcription factor whose activity regulates the responsiveness of commissural axons at the midline.
Frazzled expression is induced by the transcription factor Glide/Gcm in a dose-dependent manner.
Based on findings in other systems, we propose that adhesion to substrate-bound Net underlies both long- and short-range Net-Fra-dependent guidance in vivo, thereby eroding the distinction between them.
In disc-proper epithelial cells, Fra can affect localization of adherens junction components and columnar cell shape. 3 conserved cytoplasmic P-motifs are required. Protrusion formation required the P3 motif. Apico-basal cell shape change needed the P1 motif and was promoted by RhoGef2 but inhibited by Rac1.  The loss of AJ proteins from basolateral regions of epithelial cells required all 3 P-motifs and depended on par6.

Data show that tafazzin mutations in Drosophila generate a Barth-related phenotype, with the triad of abnormal cardiolipin, pathologic mitochondria, and motor weakness, suggesting causal links between these findings.
Drosophila tafazzin is a CoA-independent, acyl-specific phospholipid transacylase with substrate preference for cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine
The data suggest that tafazzin deficiency affects cardiolipin in all mitochondria, but significant alterations of the ultrastructure, such as remodeling and aggregation of inner membranes, will only occur after specific differentiation.
tafazzin deficiency in Drosophila disrupts the final stage of spermatogenesis, spermatid individualization, and causes male sterility
the characteristic fatty acid profile of cardiolipin is not determined by the substrate specificity of tafazzin
propose that tafazzin reacts with non-bilayer-type lipid domains that occur in curved or hemifused membrane zones and that acyl specificity is driven by the packing properties of these domains

Control of Drosophila wing growth by the vestigial quadrant enhancer.
vg-dependent, vg-inducing signal feeds forward from one cell to the next to entrain surrounding cells to join the growing wing primordium in response to Wg.
Data show that both Vestigial and Scalloped are required for muscle differentiation, as loss of either leads to a loss of a subset of either cardiac or somatic muscle cells in developing embryos, and also that Sd, Vg, and Dmef2 can interact directly.
Data show that vestigial is controlled by the Notch anti-myogenic signaling pathway in myoblasts and is regulated by a novel 822 bp enhancer during indirect flight muscle differentiation.
Vg is a key factor to induce specific changes in ventral longitudinal muscles 1-4 identity and is required for these cells to be competent to form stable intermuscular attachments with each other.
Studies indicate that negative regulation of the Vestigial gradient by Wingless signaling makes vestigial expression precise and robust.
Data show that genes araucan and caupolican as novel muscle identity genes that confer lateral transverse muscle identity, and the acquisition of this fate requires that Araucan/Caupolican repress other muscle identity genes such as slouch and vestigial.
High hydrostatic pressure-induced wing mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in 285 differentially expressed genes and two point mutations in the vestigial gene.
here we examine the interactions between Msk and the Wg pathway in regulation of the AMP pool size. We find that a myoblast-specific reduction of Msk results in the absence of Vg expression and a complete loss of the Wg pathway readout beta-catenin/Armadillo (Arm). Moreover, msk RNA interference knockdown abolishes expression of the Wg target Ladybird (Lbe) in leg disc myoblasts.
Vestigial protein phosphorylation of serine 215 occurs in the nucleus and requires the presence of Scalloped.
Study shows that Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) near the wing selector gene vestigial have distinctive roles at their endogenous locus, even though both PREs are repressors in transgenes. First, a PRE near the promoter is required for vestigial activation and not for repression. Second, only the distal PRE contributes to H3K27me3, but even removal of both PREs does not eliminate H3K27me3 across the vestigial domain.
Vestigial suppresses apoptosis and cell migration in a manner dependent on the level of JNK-Caspase signaling in the Drosophila wing disc.

centrosomes eject particles of centrosomin-containing pericentriolar material that move on dynamic astral microtubules at a rate that varies with the cell cycle
Results suggest that Aurora-A regulates centrosome assembly by controlling centrosomin's (CNN) ability to target and/or anchor gamma-tubulin to the centrosome and to organize microtubule-nucleating sites via interaction with CNN.
Cnn Motif 1 is necessary for proper recruitment of gamma-tubulin, D-TACC (the homolog of vertebrate transforming acidic coiled-coil proteins [TACC]), and Minispindles (Msps) to embryonic centrosomes
Data suggest that centrosomin maintains the proper connection between the centrioles and the pericentriolar matrix, which is required for accurate centriole segregation in somatic cells but is not essential for the asymmetric division of neuroblasts.
Results show that that several MTs originate from acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers (aMTOCs) that contain gamma-tubulin and require Centrosomin (Cnn) for normal architecture and function.
characterization of a new class of Cnn short isoforms required for centrosome function during gametogenesis and embryogenesis;evidence for a complex mix of Cnn isoforms present during early embryogenesis
Data suggest that centrioles can control the amount of pericentriolar material (PCM) they organize by regulating the rate of Cnn incorporation into the PCM.
Data suggest that centrosome size asymmetry in Drosophila neuroblasts is generated by the differential regulation of Cnn incorporation into the PCM at mother and daughter centrioles.
Data indicate that interphase centrioles are closely associated with Sas-4, Spd-2, Polo kinase, Pericentrin-like protein (Dplp), Asterless (Asl), Plk4 kinase, Centrosomin (Cnn) and gamma-tubulin.
Cnn and PLP directly interact at two defined sites to coordinate the cell cycle-dependent rearrangement and scaffolding activity of the centrosome to permit normal centrosome organization, cell division, and embryonic viability.
The findings reveal that polarized targeting of Centrosomin to Golgi outposts during elaboration of the dendrite arbor creates a local system for guiding microtubule polymerization.
During pericentriolar matrix formation exon 1A Cnn-Long Form proteins likely bind Polo kinase before phosphorylation by Polo for Cnn transport to the centrosome.
Study shows that cnn exon1A-encoded proteins interact with Polo at 2 residues and that this interaction is required for polar body and pericentriolar matrix formation in syncytial embryos.
Drosophila centrosomin (cnn) expresses two major protein variants: the centrosomal form (CnnC) and a non-centrosomal form in testes (CnnT). CnnC is established as essential for functional centrosomes, the major MTOCs in animal cells. CnnT is expressed exclusively in testes and localizes to giant mitochondria in spermatids.
suggest an expanded model where during interphase CM2 interacts with pericentrin-like-protein to form a layer of centrosomin around the centriole wall and that at the onset of mitosis this population acts as a nucleation site of intramolecular centrosomin interactions that support the expansion into the metaphase matrix
These findings suggest that interactions between Spd-2, Polo and Cnn form a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the mitotic pericentriolar material in fly embryos.
Cid allows for contacts betwen DNA and histones and specific targeting
Results suggest that CID mislocalization promotes formation of ectopic centromeres and multicentric chromosomes, which causes chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy, and growth defects.
Proteasome-mediated degradation restricts localization of Drosophila CENP-A (CID) to centromeres by eliminating mislocalized CID as well as by regulating available CID levels.
Study shows by quantitative fluorescence measurements in living early embryos that functional fluorescent fusion proteins of the Drosophila CENP-A and CENP-C homologs are rapidly incorporated into centromeres during anaphase.
Drosophila CENP-C is essential for centromere identity.
The F box protein partner of paired (Ppa) mediates CenH3(CID) stability in Drosophila. Ppa depletion results in increased CenH3(CID) levels. Ppa physically interacts with CenH3(CID) through the CATD(CID) that mediates Ppa-dependent CenH3(CID) stability.
CID nucleosomes are octameric in vivo and that CID dimerization is essential for correct centromere assembly.
The amount of Cid that is loaded during each cell cycle appears to be determined primarily by the preexisting centromeric Cid, with little flexibility for compensation of accidental losses.
CENP-A assembly by its loading factor, CAL1, requires RNAPII-mediated transcription of the underlying DNA
A novel role has been described for the histone acetyltransferase Hat1 in the CENP-A/CID assembly pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.
identify two co-evolving regions, CENP-A L1 and the CAL1 N terminus, as critical for lineage-specific CENP-A incorporation
centromere assembly factors CAL1 and CENP-C are required for meiotic chromosome segregation, CENP-A assembly and maintenance on sperm, as well as fertility
transcription-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for the transition of dCENP-A to fully incorporated nucleosomes at the centromere.
Cid duplication (leading to Cid6) within the Drosophila subgenus and show that not only Cid, but also Cenp-C is duplicated in the entire subgenus.
ATP synthase F1 subunits recruited to centromeres by CENP-A are required for male meiosis.
NLP and HMR largely co-localize in domains that are immediately adjacent to, yet distinct from centromere domains defined by the centromeric histone dCENP-A.
results suggest that, whereas SCF(Ppa) targets the fraction of CENP-A(CID) that is not in complex with Cal1, APC/C(Cdh1) mediates also degradation of the Cal1-CENP-A(CID) complex and, thus, likely contributes to the regulation of centromeric CENP-A(CID) deposition
Modulation of the phosphorylation state of S20 may provide the cells with a means to fine-tune CENP-A levels in order to prevent deleterious loading to extra-centromeric sites.
CENP-A levels inversely correlate with mitosis duration suggesting crosstalk of CENP-A loading with the regulatory machinery of mitosis. Mitosis length is influenced by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and authors found that CAL1 interacts with the SAC protein and RZZ complex component Zw10 and thus constitutes the anchor for the recruitment of RZZ.
The data show that Drosophila CENP-A has no intrinsic specificity for centromeric chromatin and utilizes separate loading mechanisms for its incorporation into centromeric and ectopic sites. This suggests that the specific association and availability of CENP-A interacting factors are the major determinants of CENP-A loading specificity.

A RhoGEF and Rho family GTPase-activating protein complex links the contractile ring to cortical microtubules at the onset of cytokinesis.
the RacGap50C gene product participates in the negative regulation of Wg pathway activity
Tumleweed (RacGAP50C) serves as a scaffolding protein in regulating cell division but acts as a GAP to limit axon growth in postmitotic neurons.
in addition to its role in activating RhoA signalling, RacGAP50C also controls the proper assembly of the actomyosin ring by interacting with Anillin at the cleavage furrow
mislocalization of RacGAP50C in pavarotti mutants is sufficient to redistribute gamma-tubulin to the muscle fiber ends
Results identify two modulators of the Wnt pathway, Tum and Pav, that have shared functions in cell division, which hints at a possible link between cytokinesis and Wnt activity during tumorigenesis.

Short Stop provides an essential link between F-actin and microtubules during axon extension.
in fusion cells, Shot may function downstream of RhoA to form E-cadherin-associated cytoskeletal structures that are necessary for apical determinant localization

large exon within the shot locus, which encodes a series of plakin repeats similar to the COOH terminus of plakins such as plectin and BPAG1e.
Data suggest that E-cadherin controls tubule track growth with signals to F-actin and microtubules, and employs Shot to promote adherens junction-associated cytoskeletal assembly.
Data suggest that a novel transcript from the shot locus is expressed in the developing nervous system and is required for senory and motor axon development.
These data suggest that Kra(Exba)-mediated translational regulation plays important roles in midline axon repulsion and that Shot functions as a direct physical link between translational regulation and cytoskeleton reorganization.
Spectraplakins function in tissue-specific modes in vivo, and even domains believed to be crucial for Spectraplakin function can be dispensable in specific contexts.
The localization pattern of Spectraplakin in developing pupal photoreceptors showed a unique intracellular distribution.
Binding of Shot to EB1 requires SxIP motifs in Shot's C-terminal tail (Ctail); mutations of these motifs abolish Shot functions in axonal growth.
In tendon cells lacking lamin C activity, organization of Shortstop protein gradually disintegrated, notably around the nucleus and in a manner correlating well with the degradation of musculature.
The regulation of the Drosophila actin-microtubule cross-linker Short stop, was investigated.

shot is a key player in establishing the cytoskeletal arrangement required for the spatial localization of axis-determining maternal mRNAs.
Patronin and Shot then act to polarise microtubules along the apical-basal axis to enable apical transport of Rab11 endosomes by the Nuf-Dynein microtubule motor complex. Finally, Rab11 endosomes are transferred to the MyoV (also known as Didum in Drosophila) actin motor to deliver the key microvillar determinant Cadherin 99C to the apical membrane to organise the biogenesis of actin microvilli.
Shot/Patronin foci are excluded from the oocyte posterior by the Par-1 polarity kinase to generate the polarized microtubule network that localizes axis determinants
Tau and spectraplakin promote synapse formation and maintenance through Jun kinase and neuronal trafficking.
Shot-mediated interactions between microtubules and actin filaments facilitate filopodia formation, which promotes zippering by initiating contact between opposing epithelial cells.

nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of the PAZ domain from Drosophila melanogaster Argonaute 1 (Ago1)
Argonaute1 (AGO1 is required for mature miRNA production that impacts on miRNA-directed RNA cleavage.
Depletion of AGO1, the essential factor for mRNA biogenesis,led to an increased transcriptional rate of the transgenes.
A genome-wide analysis of mRNAs regulated by AGO1 was performed.
Findings argue against a strict separation of Ago1 and Ago2 functions and suggest that these proteins act in concert to control key steps of the midblastula transition and of segmental patterning.
The two members of the Drosophila Ago subclade of Argonaute proteins are functionally specialized, but specific small RNA classes are not restricted to associate with Ago1 or Ago2.
AGO1-dependent microRNA pathway probably plays an instructive role in repressing germline stem cell differentiation.
we show that all Argonautes elevate mature miRNA expression posttranscriptionally, independent of RNase activity.
These observations indicate that sticky/citron kinase functions to regulate both actin-myosin-mediated cytokinesis and epigenetic gene silencing, linking cell-cycle progression to heterochromatin assembly and inheritance of gene expression states.

unwinding of miRNA-miRNA* duplexes is a passive process that does not require ATP or slicer activity of Ago1
Data revealed an active role for Watson-Crick base-pairing at positions 9 and 10 in promoting strand selection by AGO2, with little reciprocal effect on strand selection by AGO1.

these results suggest that rho-7 and Opa1-like function in a common molecular pathway affecting mitochondrial function and apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster.
Mitochondrial fusion is regulated spatiotemporally by Ewg through Opa1-like during indirect flight muscles differentiation and growth.
lack of ChChd3 leads to inactivation of Hippo activity under normal development, which is also dependent on the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Furthermore, loss of ChChd3 induces oxidative stress and activates the JNK pathway. In addition, depletion of other mitochondrial fusion components, Opa1 or Marf, inactivates the Hippo pathway as well.
Depletion of Mitofusin (dMfn) or Opa1 led to dysfunctional mitochondria, activation of Target of rapamycin (TOR) and a marked accumulation of lipid droplets. Enhancement of lipid utilization by the mitochondria attenuated TOR activation and rescued the loss of GSCs that was caused by inhibition of mitochondrial fusion.

Binding sites for the Drosophila boundary element-associated factors BEAF-32A and -32B are required for the insulator activity of the scs' insulator, that BEAF-dependent insulators function by affecting chromatin structure or dynamics
broad role of the BEAF-32A and BEAF-32B proteins in maintaining patterns of gene expression during eye development
Combined with the effects on male X polytene chromosomes, we conclude that BEAF function affects chromatin structure or dynamics.
The DNA sequences that bind to BEAF in vivo are also associated with the nuclear matrix and colocalize with BEAF.
These results provide an unexpected link between BEAF and transcription, suggesting that BEAF-32A/B plays a role in maintaining most associated promoter regions in an environment that facilitates high transcription levels.
DNA binding proteins such as BEAF-32 may have a dramatic impact in the genome of single evolutionary lineages.
BEAF does not localize near the transcription start sites of any genes in the Antennapedia complex, indicating that BEAF does not locally affect regulation of these genes
BEAF is a positive regulator of the chromatin domain boundary that separates myoglianin and eyeless genes.
Miss-regulation of these genes explains the unregulated cell growth and neoplastic phenotypes observed in imaginal tissues of BEAF-32 mutants.
Loss of BEAF-32 does not noticeably impair the functions of the Hippo pathway in eye growth regulation.
we identify key roles for the Zelda and Zerknullt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain, and find widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein shows reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak BMP signaling.
The BESS domain alone is sufficient to mediate BEAF-BEAF interactions, although the presence of the putative leucine zipper on at least one protein strengthens the interactions. BEAF-32B is sufficient to rescue a null BEAF mutation. Using mutant BEAF-32B rescue transgenes, we show that the middle region and the BESS domain are essential.

These data show that Cdk5 regulates the onset and extent of remodeling of the Drosophila mushroom body.
These data indicate that Cdk5 is required to maintain the protective role of basal autophagy in the initial responses to a subset of neurodegenerative challenges via phosphorylating Acinus at serine 437.
This result suggests that attenuating CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CP190 may enhance its in vivo insulator activity at the gypsy transposon
pharmaceutical inhibition of CDK5 prevents glioma stem cell self-renewal in vitro and in xenografted tumors, at least partially by suppressing CREB1 activation independently of PKA/cAMP.
Wnt-activated growth of the postsynaptic membrane is mediated by the synapse-to-nucleus translocation and active nuclear import of Fz2-C via a selective Importin-beta11/alpha2 pathway [Importin-beta11]
Our observations point to an important function for Zasp in the assembly of integrin adhesion sites both in cell culture and in tissues.
Transcriptional analysis of dzasp has revealed six additional exons, with respect to the known 16, and multiple splice variants
stage- and tissue-specific expression in different muscle types for Zasp52 isoforms encoding different LIM domains.
Zasp is the first protein shown to co-activate alpha5beta1 integrins with talin and appears to do so in a manner distinct from known alphaIIbbeta3 integrin co-activators.
Zasp52 is required for the association of alpha-actinin with the flight muscle Z-disc, and for normal sarcomere structure.
Zasp52 and Zasp66 directly bind to alpha-actinin, and they can also form a ternary complex.
analysis of Zasp52 nonmuscle expression and epithelial apicobasal localization
Flight assays also show that a Zasp52 mutant suppresses the a-actinin mutant phenotype, indicating that both proteins are core structural Z-disc proteins required for optimal Z-disc function.
Here the authors show that the PDZ and LIM domain protein Zasp, a structural component of Z-discs, mediates Z-disc and thereby myofibril growth through protein oligomerization.

Pox neuro has roles in Drosophila male courtship, fertility, segmentation of the leg disc and antennal disc, and development of the wing hinge
expression in embryonic brain
poxn is involved in suppressing bract formation near the chemosensory bristles.
Pox neuro controls cell lineages that give rise to larval poly-innervated external sensory organs in Drosophila.
The paired box gene Pox neuro (Poxn) is expressed in two bilaterally symmetric neuronal clusters of the developing adult Drosophila brain, a protocerebral dorsal cluster (DC) and a deutocerebral ventral cluster (VC). The study shows that all cells that express Poxn in the developing brain are postmitotic neurons.  Poxn is crucial for pathfinding both in the DC and VC.
Combinatorial Pharyngeal Taste Coding for Feeding Avoidance in Adult Drosophila.
At the CNS midline, Slit functions as a repellent for tracheal branches and this function is mediated primarily by Robo. Robo2 is necessary for the tracheal response to the attractive Slit signal and its function is antagonized by Robo.
robo, robo2, and robo3 play a role in the guidance of sensory axons in the Drosophila embryo by both slit-dependent and slit-independent mechanisms.
midline-secreted Slit activates Robo/Robo2 signalling to control the migration of the vmd1a sensory precursor cells
schizo regulates Slit expression via endocytosis
Slit and Robo-family proteins act to maintain the distinct cellular composition of the developing lamina and the lobula cortex
loss of a neutralizing effect on the Netrin-mediated attraction is responsible for the longitudinal axonal tracts entering the midline in slit mutants
NETRIN serves as a chemo-attractant while SLIT functions antagonistically to NETRIN as a chemo-repellent during embryonic salivary gland migration parallel to the CNS in Drosophila.
Slit and Robo proteins contribute to heart morphogenesis by guiding cell alignment and adhesion and/or by inhibiting cell mixing between the bilateral compartments of heart cell progenitors and ensuring proper polarity of the myocardial epithelium.
slit is required for heart assembly
Results describe the role of Slit and its transmembrane receptors Roundabout (Robo) and Roundabout2 (Robo2) during morphogenesis of the Drosophila heart tube, a process analogous to early heart formation in vertebrates.
Slit is present outside of the midline along the longitudinal and commissural tracts.
Data show that on binding of Slit to Robo, the adaptor protein Cables is recruited to Robo-associated Abl and forms a multimeric complex by binding directly to N-cadherin-associated beta-catenin.
Slit and Robo control the development of dendrites in the embryonic Central Nervous System
Our data show that Slit and Robo pathways function in lumen formation as a repulsive signal to antagonize E-Cad-mediated cell adhesion.
Slit, through Robo, provides an extrinsic signal to coordinate the growth rate and the branching level of space-filling neurons, thus allowing them to appropriately cover their target field.
Dlp, which lacks chondroitin sulfate (CS)modifications, participates in the transfer of Slit from its site of expression to the target cells, where CS-modified Sdc concentrates and presents the ligand.
the midline signalling systems Slit/Robo and Netrin/Frazzled are the main molecular mechanisms that underlie dendritic targeting with respect to the midline.
the medio-lateral positioning of motoneuron dendrites in the leg neuropil is controlled by the midline signalling systems Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra.
during normal development, gradients of Slit protein repel axons away from compartment boundaries - in consequence, the bristles from each segment send their nerves to the CNS in separated sets
the Slit/Roundabout pathway, best known for its role in regulating axonal guidance, is essential for proper gonad formation
Distinct functional domains of the Abelson tyrosine kinase control axon guidance responses to Netrin and Slit to regulate the assembly of neural circuits
these findings show that the polarized localization of Mp controls the direction, timing, and presumably the extent of Slit/Robo activity and signaling at the luminal membrane of the heart cardioblasts.
Data show that Slit cleavage restricts its distribution to tendon cells, allowing it to function as a short-range repellent that directs muscle migration and patterning, and promotes their halt upon reaching the target site.
The single-growth-cone analysis suggests that Slit and RPTP69D are unlikely to influence axon sprouting, or branch initiation of mechanosensory-neurons, but rather control the selective consolidation and directed extension of midline-crossing axon branches.
Slit-binding is necessary for its repulsive signaling output
a Robo2-mediated mechanism, independent of signaling, is essential to limiting Slit distribution and which might be relevant to the regulation of Slit-mediated short-range signaling in additional systems
These results suggest that Slit cleaveage, and the formation of Slit-N oligomers on the tendon cell surfaces direct muscle elongation, provide a stop signal for the approaching muscle.
Vascular cells produce Slit that activates Robo receptors in the posterior signalling centre of the larval haematopoietic organ, the lymph gland.
Dscam1 appears to modify the output of Robo and Slit complexes so that signaling is no longer repulsive
the role of Slit and Robo receptors in wiring Drosophila higher-order brain circuits and identified differences in the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Robo/Slit function, was investigated.
repulsive Slit-Robo2-Ena signaling exerts an extrusive force downstream of JNK to eliminate scrib cells from epithelia by disrupting E-cadherin.
Mmy is required for Slit secretion and for maintaining Robo abundance and distribution in the developing nervous system in Drosophila.
loss of Atg16 or its binding partner Rab19 impairs Slit production, which normally inhibits enteroendocrine cell generation by activating Robo signaling in stem cells.
Slit neuronal secretion coordinates optic lobe morphogenesis in Drosophila.
Proteolytic cleavage of Slit by the Tolkin protease converts an axon repulsion cue to an axon growth cue in vivo.

precise timing of larval tissue cell death during metamorphosis is achieved through a steroid-triggered shift in the balance between the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and the rpr and hid death activators
Inhibitor of apoptosis 2 and TAK1-binding protein are components of the Imd pathway, which controls antimicrobial peptide expression in Drosophila.
Results identify DIAP2 as an essential component of the Imd signaling cascade, protecting the organism from infiltrating microbes.
diap2 may identify a point of convergence between apoptosis and immune signaling pathways
Required to sustain antimicrobial peptide gene expression; inactivation results in impaired microbial resistance.
Because DIAP2 efficiently interacts with drICE, our data suggest that DIAP2 controls drICE in its apoptotic and nonapoptotic roles.
The authors show that stimulation of the Drosophila pattern recognition protein PGRP-LCx induces DIAP2-dependent polyubiquitylation of the initiator caspase DREDD.
cleaved protein retains the ability to interact with immune deficiency pathway signal transduction
This suggests that DIAP2 and LUBEL work together to promote Kenny-mediated activation of Relish..We found LUBEL-mediated M1-Ub chain formation to be required for flies to survive oral infection with Gram-negative bacteria, for activation of Relish-mediated expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and for pathogen clearance during oral infection
role in the control of cell growth in eye development
Mlf and its mutant were characterized. Mlf can act developmentaly and post-developmentally to suppress neurodegeneration and premature aging in a cerebellar ataxia model.
MLF1 has been described as mainly cytoplasmic, but in Drosophila, one of the dMLF isoforms (dMLFA) localized mainly in the nucleus.
Data revealed that MLF interacts with CSN3 in vivo and that the PCI domain of the dCSN3 protein is sufficient for this to occur, possibly functioning as a structural scaffold for assembly of the COP9 signalosome complex.
mlf participates in a positive feedback loop to fine tune the activity of the RUNX transcription factor Lozenge (LZ) during development of the crystal cells.
our data indicate that the MLF/DnaJ-1-dependent increase in Lz level allows the repression of Notch expression and signaling to prevent aberrant blood cell development. Thus our findings establish a functional link between MLF and the co-chaperone DnaJ-1 to control RUNX transcription factor activity and Notch signaling during blood cell development in vivo.
These results are consistent with a model in which phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis acts via Ca2+ to activate myosin via MLCK and thereby control actin dynamics during constriction of the contractile ring.
elucidation of an inhibitory mechanism of the immune deficiency pathway by Caspar will provide a valuable insight into understanding complex regulatory mechanisms of the innate immune systems in both Drosophila and mammals.

Pathway of ADP-stimulated ADP release and dissociation of tethered kinesin from microtubules. Implications for the extent of processivity

Data show that kinesin heavy chain can function independently of the light chain in the oocyte, indicating that it associates with its cargoes by a novel mechanism.
Substitution of Glu164 with alanine in the motor domain results in a dimeric kinesin (E164A) with a dramatic reduction in microtubule-activated steady-state ATPase that is stalled on the microtubule and cannot bind and hydrolyze ATP at the second head.
the discovery that kinesin limps along the microtubule, taken together with its other nanomechanical properties, implies that it advances by some form of asymmetric hand-over-hand mechanism

Amylolytic activity of Amyrel is about thirty times weaker than the classical Drosophila alpha-amylase, and the substitution of the arginine by a glutamine in D. melanogaster suppressed the chloride-dependence but was detrimental to activity. In contrast, changing the glutamine into an arginine rendered D. virilis Amyrel chloride-dependent, and interestingly, significantly increased its catalytic efficiency.
ifferential mass spectrometry analysis of these cells detected elevated levels of four of the six Idgf family members (Idgf1, Idgf2, Idgf4, and Idgf6) in flies mutant for bullwinkle (bwk), which encodes a transcription factor and is a known regulator of DA-tube morphogenesis. We show that, during oogenesis, dysregulation of Idgfs (either gain or loss of function) disrupts the formation of the DA tubes
Our data thus indicate that Imac transports components required for synaptic maturation and provide insight into presynaptic maturation as a process that can be differentiated from axon outgrowth and targeting.
Drosophila Unc-104 has neuronal functions that are distinct from those of the classic anterograde axonal motor, kinesin-1.
Unc-104 critically restricts neuromuscular junction growth and dendrite branch morphogenesis.
provide novel insights into the role of Unc-104 in synapse maturation
These studies at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction indicate that many synaptic defects in unc-104-null mutants are mediated independently of Unc-104's transport function, via the Wallenda (Wnd)/DLK MAP kinase axonal damage signaling pathway.
Prd1, alpha-Adaptin, and Unc-104 act in a common pathway to promote dendrite pruning by down-regulating Neuroglian protein.

SOD1 and SOD2 provide independent protection to compartment-specific protein iron-sulfur clusters against attack by superoxide generated under oxidative stress
Disruption of the protective effects of SOD2 on mitochondria manifests as profound changes in behavioral and demographic aging as well as exacerbated age-related pathology in the nervous system.
switching moribund SOD2-deficient adults from normoxia into hypoxia arrests premature mortality and endows the survivors with a near-normal life
Data show that the decline of several functional measures of aging occurs, in an accelerated fashion, in Sod2 mutants.
knockdown in the musculature has whole-organism consequences
Muscles appear to be more sensitive to superoxide attack relative to the neurons and such overt phenotypes observed in SOD2-deficient animals can be directly attributed to the muscle.
ocytes lacking maternal SOD2 protein develop into adults just like normal SOD2-containing oocytes suggesting that maternal SOD2-mediated protection against mitochondrial ROS is not essential for oocyte viability
Paraquat exposure, but not Sod2 knockdown, resulted in increased carbonylated protein relative abundance.
Depletion of superoxide dismutases promotes muscular and neuronal ROS accumulation which may have a significant effect on age-dependent impairment of the Drosophila adults.
The functional SOD1 and SOD2 genes knockout and their overexpression in neurons and glial tissue increase the sensitivity of Drosophila melanogaster to oxidative stress conditions.

PSI is required for Drosophila viability, male fertility, and cellular mRNA processing
PSI requires multiple tandem KH domains for specific and high-affinity recognition of substrate RNA
Drosophila splicing factor P element Somatic Inhibitor (PSI) is phosphorylated at at least two different sites by at minimum two different kinases, casein kinase II (CK II) and tousled-like kinase (tlk).
Thus, PSI imposes a specific mode of regulatory control within the neuronal circuit controlling courtship, even though it is broadly expressed in the fly nervous system.
the key target of the Psi/MED network in controlling developmentally regulated tissue growth is the transcription factor MYC.
PSI regulates the period of Drosophila circadian rhythms and circadian behavior phase during temperature cycling through its modulation of the tim splicing pattern.

DRhoGEF2 exerts its effects in gastrulation through the regulation of Myosin II to orchestrate coordinated apical cell constriction.

DRhoGEF2 acts through Rho1 to regulate acto-myosin constriction but not Diaphanous-mediated F-actin nucleation during segmental groove morphogenesis.
Accumulation of slam mRNA and protein at the presumptive invagination site provides a spatial and temporal trigger for RhoGEF2-Rho1 signalling.
Dia and Myosin II activity is controlled by the guanine exchange factor RhoGEF2, which is planar polarized and absent in non-intercalating regions
Results identify DRhoGEF2 as an upstream regulator of the actomyosin contractile machinery that drives amnioserosa cells pulsations and apical constriction.
early Drosophila embryogenesis is primed to form furrows at either overlapping astral microtubules or the central spindle; the shift to the latter is driven by a corresponding shift from RhoGEF2 to Pebble in controlling furrow formation.
RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an activated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, Raf (Raf(GOF)).
Frizzled-dependent planar polarity pathway locally promotes E-cadherin turnover via recruitment of RhoGEF2.
Overexpression of DRhoGEF2, and it's functional mammalian ortholog PDZ-RhoGEF (ArhGEF11), at various stages of eye development, resulted in both dPKB/Akt-dependent and -independent phenotypes in Drosophila

findings show Lhr has functionally diverged in D. simulans & interacts with Hybrid male rescue, which has functionally diverged in D. melanogaster, to cause lethality in F1 hybrid males; LHR has diverged in these species consistent with positive selection
LHR orthologs interact with HP1 and HP6, and can localize to heterochromatin when expressed in D. melanogaster.
Results are consistent with the allelic asymmetry model of the Lhr gene expression in the hybrid.
Using RNA-Seq analyses we discovered that Hmr and Lhr are required to repress transcripts from satellite DNAs and many families of transposable elements (TEs).
We conclude that there is no evidence for a centromeric function of Hmr and Lhr within D. melanogaster nor for a centromere defect causing hybrid lethality. Instead, we find that Hmr and Lhr are required in D. melanogaster for detachment of sister chromatids during anaphase.
EDTP gene is crucial in oogenesis and embryogenesis.

Crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster LC7 in the apo form and in complex with a segment of the disordered N-terminal domain of dynein intermediate chain (IC) provide the first definitive identification of the IC sequence recognized by LC7.
LC8 binding promotes IC self-association of helix 1 from each of two IC chains, whereas LC7(Roadblock) binding reverses self-association by incorporating the same residues into two symmetrical, but distant, helices of the LC7-IC complex
Ssp4, renamed Patronin, protects microtubule minus ends against depolymerization by Kinesin-13; in its absence, microtubules release from their nucleating sites and treadmill through the cytoplasm, a result of unhindered minus end depolymerization.
A recent study provides the first definitive identification of a minus-end-specific capping protein, termed Patronin, which protects the microtubule arrays of both mitotic and interphase cells.
Anaphase B is induced by the minus end-stabilizing protein patronin, which antagonizes the kinesin-13 depolymerase KLP10A at spindle poles.
These results show that members of the CAMSAP/Patronin family all localize to and protect minus-ends but have evolved distinct effects on microtubule dynamics.
Patronin and Shot then act to polarise microtubules along the apical-basal axis to enable apical transport of Rab11 endosomes by the Nuf-Dynein microtubule motor complex. Finally, Rab11 endosomes are transferred to the MyoV (also known as Didum in Drosophila) actin motor to deliver the key microvillar determinant Cadherin 99C to the apical membrane to organise the biogenesis of actin microvilli.
Shot/Patronin foci are excluded from the oocyte posterior by the Par-1 polarity kinase to generate the polarized microtubule network that localizes axis determinants
This study demonstrates that Patronin orients minus-end-out microtubules arrays in dendrites to promote dendrite-specific pruning mainly through antagonizing Klp10A activity.
our data suggest that Patronin facilitates sustained microtubule minus end growth, which is critical for populating dendrites with minus-end-out microtubules.

evidence that the JNK pathway scaffold protein, POSH, is involved in TNF (Eiger) signaling in Drosophila
POSH promotes cell survival in Drosophila and in human rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts
The data data uncover Rab8, POSH, and TAK1 as regulators of synaptic growth responses and point to recycling endosome as a key compartment for synaptic growth regulation during neurodegenerative processes.
The pro-apoptotic JNK scaffold protein POSH mediates CHMP2BIntron5-associated toxicity in animal models of frontotemporal dementia.

results indicate that R2D2 bridges the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway by facilitating small interfering RNA (siRNA) passage from Dicer to RNA-initiated silencing complex (RISC)
Dicer-2 is required for siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage, though its RNase III activity is not required. Dicer-2 facilitates distinct steps in the assembly of siRISC.
SiRNAs must first interact with Dcr-2 to reach the R3 "holo-RISC" complex. Dcr-2 assembles into RISC along with the siRNAs, indicating that its role extends beyond the initiation phase of RNAi.
Dcr-2 is a host susceptibility locus for virus infections.
Dicer-1 and Dicer-2 are required for short interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed mRNA cleavage by facilitating distinct steps in the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
These results provide further insight into the structure-function relationship of Dicer, which plays a critical role in the siRNA pathway.

substrates of Dicer-2
Mutation of a pair of conserved arginine residues in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain blocked cleavage of short, but not long, dsRNA.  Inorganic phosphate occupies a PAZ domain pocket needed to bind the 5' terminal phosphate of short substrates, blocking their use.
[review] Dicer-2 functions as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral RNA.
Inorganic phosphate occupies the phosphate-binding pocket in the fly Dicer-2, blocking binding of pre-miRNA and restricting pre-miRNA processing to Dicer-1.
Data show that dmDcr-2's partner protein, Loquacious-PD, alters termini dependence, enabling dmDcr-2 to cleave substrates normally refractory to cleavage.
Partial reconstitution of the RNAi response in human cells has been demonstrated using Drosophila gene products, DCR-2, Loqs-PD, and R2D2.
Study found that dsRNA-binding domain of Dicer-2 is crucial for efficient and high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production and for siRNA loading to Argonaute2.
studies indicate that the 22 amino acids at the C terminus of Loqs-PD, including an FDF-like motif, directly interact with the Hel2 subdomain of Dicer-2's helicase domain. This interaction is RNA-independent, but we find that modulation of Dicer-2 cleavage also requires dsRNA binding by Loqs-PD.
binding preference for the thermodynamically more stable siRNA end by Loqs-PD alone is greatly amplified in complex with Dcr-2 to initiate strand discrimination by asymmetry sensing in the RISC loading complex.
this study used cryo-electron microscopy to solve structures of Drosophila Dicer-2 alone and in complex with blunt dsRNA.
The results uncover a novel function of Dicer-2 in activation of mRNA translation through cytoplasmic polyadenylation.
Loqs-PD removes the inhibitory effect of inorganic phosphate on Dicer-2 processing of blunt-end hairpin RNAs, allowing siRNA production in the presence of inorganic phosphate.

dSmurf specifically targets phosphorylated MAD to proteasome-dependent degradation and regulates DPP signaling during development.
Study shows that Fused (Fu), a serine/threonine kinase that regulates Hedgehog, functions in concert with the E3 ligase Smurf to regulate ubiquitination and proteolysis of the BMP receptor Thickveins in germline stem cells daughter cystoblasts.
Smurf-mediated differential proteolysis generates dynamic BMP signaling in germline stem cells during Drosophila testis development.
Smo interacts with Smurf and promotes it to mediate Patched ubiquitination by targeting the K1261 site in Ptc.
Sufficient knock-down of dSmurf increases the protein abundance of Wts and thus increases phosphorylation level at S168 of Yki, the key downstream target of Wts in the Hippo pathway.
Interaction with Slimb leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of dSmurf, resulting in negative regulation of dSmurf-mediated Yki phosphorylation and activity in the Hippo pathway. Thus our study revealed a new regulatory mechanism of the Hippo pathway which may provide implications for developing tumor treatment.
dSmurf is required for synapse remodeling and axon pruning by glia
Together, our results demonstrate that transcriptional repression of Ed followed by Smurf-mediated downregulation of pretranslated Ed in amnioserosa regulates the establishment of a taut leading edge during dorsal closure

evidence for a wound response pathway that senses aseptic breaks in the barrier epidermis of Drosophila embryos; a minimal 472-bp Ddc wound response enhancer requires a Grh protein binding site and the function of the grh gene
In the abdomen, Grh terminates neural proliferation by regulating the competence of neuroblasts to undergo apoptosis in response to Abdominal-A expression
Grainy head is essential for post-embryonic neuroblasts to adopt the stem cell program appropriate to their position within the central nervous system; furthermore, ectopic expression of Grh is sufficient to promote ectopic E-cadherin.
the grainyhead gene, which encodes a DNA binding protein, interacts with one Polycomb response element of the bithorax complex
The level of Grh-mediated transcriptional wound responses is activated by Stit upon wounding coordinates cytoskeletal rearrangements.
Grainyhead and Zelda compete for binding to the promoters of the earliest-expressed Drosophila genes
Phosphorylation of Grainy head by ERK is essential for wound-dependent regeneration but not for development of an epidermal barrier
results suggest that Grh acts as an activator to support expression of ind, which was surprising as we identified this factor using an element that mediates dorsally-localized repression
The transcription factor Grainy head and the steroid hormone ecdysone drive the production of two partially overlapping sets of cuticle factors.
Grh remains bound to at least 1146 genomic loci over days of development.  Grh binds to target genes well before the Grh-dependent transcriptional program commences.
Grh and Vvl participate in a regulatory network controlling epithelial maturation.
Grh, AbdA, and Exd function together at multiple motifs on the apoptotic enhancer. Exd-Grh-Notch work with different Hox genes through region specific enhancers to pattern respective segments of larval central nervous system.
Using ATAC-seq across a panel of Drosophila inbred strains, we found that SNPs affecting binding sites of the TF Grainy head (Grh) causally determine the accessibility of epithelial enhancers. Authors show that deletion and ectopic expression of Grh cause loss and gain of DNA accessibility, respectively.
Grh knockdown disrupts actomyosin dynamics upon injury of the Drosophila pupa epithelial tissue.
Establishment of chromatin accessibility by the conserved transcription factor Grainy head is developmentally regulated.
Orai1 is an essential component or regulator of the CRAC channel complex
results demonstrate that the protein CRACM1 encoded by olf186-F is essential for store-operated Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels
The human ortholog of drosophila olf186-F interacts with STIM1 to regulate the amplitude of store-operated calcium entry.
results indicate that Orai itself forms the Ca2+-selectivity filter of the CRAC channel
Interaction with the C terminus of Stim thus induces Orai dimers to dimerize, forming tetramers that constitute the Ca(2+)-selective pore.
The crystal structure of Orai from Drosophila melanogaster, determined at 3.35 angstrom resolution, reveals that the calcium channel is composed of a hexameric assembly of Orai subunits arranged around a central ion pore.
Data indicate that STIM functions as sensors of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen and translocate into ER-PM (plasma membrane) junctions to tether and activate Orai channels when ER Ca2+ concentration decreases.
These studies suggest that modulation of SOCE could serve as a novel mechanism for restoring dopamine levels in dopaminergic neurons.
Ca2+ uptake in neurons with reduced SEPT7 requires Orai.
after depletion of Ca(2+) stores in Drosophila, translocation of the IP3R to Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma-membrane junctions facilitates the coupling of STIM to Orai that leads to activation of Store-operated Ca(2+) entry.
using a gain-of-function mutation that constitutively activates the channel, we present an X-ray structure of Drosophila melanogaster Orai in an open conformation. Well-defined electron density maps reveal that the pore is dramatically dilated on its cytosolic side in comparison to the slender closed pore.

biochemical properties, activation mode and in vivo role of Pro-PO3 (PPO3) are likely distinct from those of the other two Pro-PO enzymes involved in Drosophila physiology.
rPPO1 and rPPO2 were expressed as apo-rPPO and became holo-PPO upon Cu(2+) binding; rPPO3 was holo-PPO immediately after expression.
Therefore, rPPO1 can be sequentially cleaved in at least three places by alpha-chymotrypsin to produce activated rPO1(60-kD).
An important role for PPO1 and PPO2 in the survival to infection with Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, underlining the importance of melanization in insect host defense.
Genomic insertion of a PPO1(A480V) transgene phenocopies Black cells, proving that A480V is indeed the causal mutation of the historical Black cells phenotype.
PPO1 and PPO2 contribute to the bulk of melanization in the hemolymph, upon septic or clean injury. In contrast, PPO3, is expressed in lamellocytes and contributes to melanization during the encapsulation process.
Plant phenolics are detoxified by prophenoloxidase in the insect gut.
This study indicates that the mechanism of prophenoloxidase activation influences phenoloxidase (PO) activity. It also suggests that PO-induced different intermediates may affect the antibacterial activity during melanization due to their toxicity.

model proposed in which the GW182 silencing domain promotes translational repression, at least in part, by interfering with mRNA circularization and also recruits the deadenylase complex through the interaction with PABPC1
Efficient msl-2 mRNA silencing via the 3' UTR requires both a poly(A) tail and PABP function, indicating that UNR directly interacts with PABP.
These findings reveal that despite species-specific differences in the relative strength of the PABPC1-binding sites, the interaction between GW182 proteins and PABPC1 is critical for miRNA-mediated silencing in animal cells.
Pabp binds to A-rich sequences (ARS) in the osk 3'UTR and these turned out to be required in vivo for osk function during early oogenesis.

dFMRP and Caprin collaborate to control the cell cycle at the MBT by directly mediating the normal repression of maternal Cyclin B mRNA and the activation of zygotic fruhstart mRNA.
We propose that mutual inhibitions between Aurora B and Cyclin B regulate the duration of abscission and thereby the number of sister cells in each cyst.
During meiotic prophase in Drosophila males, transcript for the core cell cycle protein Cyclin B1 (CycB) is expressed in spermatocytes, but the protein does not accumulate in spermatocytes until just before the meiotic divisions.
Cyclin B1-Cdk1 localized at the spindle midzone in an Aurora B-dependent manner, with incompletely separated chromosomes showing the highest Cdk1 activity. Slowing down anaphase chromosome motion delayed Cyclin B1 degradation and mitotic exit in an Aurora B-dependent manner.

genetic screen of the third chromosome for mutations that result in mislocalization of an INAD-GFP fusion protein
Through biochemical and structural studies, study shows that the redox potential of PDZ5 is allosterically regulated by its interaction with another INAD domain, PDZ4.
show that INAD PDZ3 binds to the TRP channel tail with a new mechanism. A 15-residue C-terminal tail of TRP forms a b hairpin structure and binds to a surface of INAD PDZ3 outside the canonical target-binding aB/bB groove. Amino acid residues from both strands of the TRP b hairpin are engaged in binding, and thus the INAD PDZ3/TRP interaction is highly specific and with high affinity.
Guided by the structure of the INAD-NORPA complex, we discover that INADL is probably a mammalian counterpart of INAD. The INADL PDZ89 tandem specifically binds to PLCb4 with a mode that is strikingly similar to that of the INAD-NORPA complex, as revealed by the structure of the INADL PDZ89-PLCb4 CC-PBM complex.

Drosophila asrij functions in the hematopoietic lineage
a role for Asrij in causing increased Notch signaling thereby affecting hemocyte differentiation
ARF1-Asrij endocytic axis modulates signals that govern hematopoietic development.
Results show that in addition to its requirement in hematopoiesis, the ARF1-Asrij axis can differentially regulate humoral immunity in Drosophila, most likely by virtue of its endosomal function. ARF1 and Asrij bring about differential endocytic modulation of immune pathways and their depletion leads to aberrant pathway activity and an immune imbalance.

The role of Twist in the Toll/Dorsal signaling pathway that specifies patterning thresholds of gene expression
anterior-gut formation is mechanically induced by the movement of germ-band extension through the induction of Twist expression in stomodeal cells
High Twist levels direct cells to the body wall muscle fate, whereas low levels are permissive for gut muscle and fat body fate.
twi expression in Drosophila during gastrulation and mesoderm formation was compared to twi expression in the same embryonic development stages in Tribolium castaneum.
Dorsal activates twist and snail, and the Dorsal/Twist/Snail network activates and represses other zygotic genes to form the dorsoventral axis in Drosophila.
Twist binds to almost all mesodermal cis-regulatory modules to provide the competence to integrate inputs from more specialized transcription factors.
These experiments show that mechanically induced Twist upregulation in stomodeal cells is necessary for subsequent midgut differentiation in Drosophila embryos.
Data show that cell fate decisions in the dorsal and lateral Twi- and Tin-positive mesoderm of Drosophila melanogaster depend on the antagonistic action of the transcription factor Lame duck and the zinc finger homeodomain factor Zfh1.
conclude that Twi is an essential Notch co-regulator in myogenic progenitor cells and has the potential to confer specificity on Notch signalling at over 170 genes, showing that a single factor can have a profound effect on the output of the pathway.
Our studies identify Akirin as a nuclear factor that genetically interacts with the BRM complex and is required for optimal expression of the Twist-dependent Dmef2 enhancer
The level of Twi activity determines whether the cellular events of ventral furrow formation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell division and mesodermal migration occur.
Findings provide mechanistic insight into the brake on myogenesis that occurs during mesoderm specification: twist and tin expression at early stages in turn activate the myogenic inhibitor Him; yet, once Twist or Tin levels decline at mid-embryogenesis, Him is no longer expressed in the mesoderm, and MEF2-dependent muscle differentiation can proceed.
ch-responsive enhancers are activated synchronously in Drosophila embryos; Priming by Twist and Dorsal promotes fast and sustained response to Notch
two functionally distinct microtubule-destabilizing KinI kinesin enzymes are responsible for normal chromatid-to-pole motion in Drosophila
This review reveals remarkable coordination between two kinesin 13 family members, KLP59C and KLP10A, in which KLP10A initiates microtubule depolymerization while KLP59C perpetuates depolymerization after its initiation.
Results identify KLP59D as a novel and important regulator of spindle microtubule dynamics and chromosome motility, via Pacman and Flux, in Drosophila somatic cells.

RpL22e and RpL22e-like-PA have distinct roles in Drosophila meiotic spermatocytes.
Results suggest that association of orientation disruptor (ORD) with meiotic chromosomes during mid to late G2 is required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion during prophase condensation.

A double-mutant analysis between drICE and death caspase-1 (dcp-1), another effector caspase, reveals that some cells (type I) strictly require drICE for apoptosis, whereas other cells (type II) require either drICE or dcp-1.
Data show that the effector caspase Dcp-1 and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein Bruce function to regulate both autophagy and starvation-induced cell death in Drosophila.
HeT-A mRNA is derepressed in mRNA degradation mutants dcp1, indicating that the enzyme also aid in removing full-length transcripts and/or decay intermediates.
Autophagy suppresses Dcp-1-mediated apoptotic cell death, whereas Dcp-1 positively regulates autophagy, possibly through feedback regulation.

Model binding sites for Pita or ZIPIC demonstrate a partial enhancer-blocking activity and protect gene expression from PRE-mediated silencing.
Here we have shown that the ZAD domains of ZIPIC, Pita and Zw5 form homodimers. In Drosophila transgenic lines, these proteins are able to support long-distance interaction between GAL4 activator and the reporter gene promoter.
Mutation of the Mcp Pita site disrupts blocking activity and also eliminates dCTCF binding. In contrast, mutation of the Mcp dCTCF site does not affect Pita binding, and this mutant boundary retains partial function.
Data show that depletion of Hrp59 by RNA interference reduces the levels of Rrp4 at transcription sites, which suggests that Hrp59 is needed for the exosome to stably interact with nascent pre-mRNPs.

MBF1 was found to form a ternary complex including MBF1, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the bZIP protein Tracheae Defective (TDF)/Apontic.
The data suggest that a regulatory circuit between STAT, APT, and SLBO functions to convert an initially graded signal into an all-or-nothing activation of JAK/STAT and thus to proper cell specification and migration.
The work presented here identifies two genes, apt and crz, which mediate the fly's sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation.

component of a selective dynein motor complex that drives transcript localization in a variety of tissues
Through the combined actions of the fusome, MT, and Baz, Par-1 is selectively enriched and localized within the oocyte, where, in conjunction with BicD, Egalitarian (Egl), and Dynein, it acts on the MT cytoskeleton to effect polarization.
Egl interacts directly with dynein light chain, a microtubule motor component, through an Egl domain distinct from that which binds BicD; data provide a direct link between a molecule necessary for oocyte specification and the microtubule motor complex
direct recognition of these mRNA localization signals is mediated by the Egalitarian (Egl) protein
In the absence of Egl function, oocyte microtubules completely fail to reorganize. Egl also appears to function in regulating the translation of critical polarity determining mRNAs.
artificially dimerized Egl activates dynein-dynactin-BicD in the absence of mRNA. The ability of mRNA cargo to orchestrate the activation of the mRNP (messenger ribonucleotide protein) complex is an elegant way to ensure that only cargo-bound motors are motile.
the RNA is required for robust activation of dynein motility. We show that a cis-acting RNA localisation signal promotes the interaction of Egl with BicD, which licenses the latter protein to recruit dynein and dynactin. Our data support a model for BicD activation based on RNA-induced occupancy of two Egl-binding sites on the BicD dimer.
following germline piRNA depletion, abundant maternal HeT-A RNP interacts with Egl resulting in ectopic accumulation of Egl close to the centrosomes during the syncytial stage of embryogenesis; findings suggest that its abnormal localization likely leads to impaired embryonic axis specification typical for piRNA pathway mutants

Data indicate that matrix metalloproteinases mmp1 and mmp2 mutants have distinct heart phenotypes.
there are only two MMP genes in Drosophila, DmMmp1 and DmMmp2, which makes Drosophila an attractive system to analyze the basis of MMP specificity. Previously, Drosophila MMPs have been categorized by their pericellular localization, as Mmp1 appeared to be secreted and Mmp2 appeared to be membrane-anchored, suggesting that protein localization was the critical distinction in this small MMP family

The genetic interactions between dSETDB1 and Su(var)3-9 mutations emphasize the importance of maintaining the activities of these histone methyltransferases in balance for normal genome function.
Together with Egg, Wde localizes to euchromatin, is enriched on chromosome 4, and binds to the Painting of fourth (POF) protein.
dSet1 is responsible for the bulk of H3K4 di- and trimethylation throughout Drosophila development.

a major requirement for the methyltransferase Eggless/SetDB1 in the establishment of heterochromatin
SETDB1 is required for chromosome binding of SU(VAR)3-9.
In ovarian somatic cells, Egg is monoubiquitinated and phosphorylated but only monoubiquitination is required for piRNA-mediated transposon repression. Egg monoubiquitination occurs in the nucleus. Egg has its own nuclear localization signal, and the nuclear import of Egg is Wde-independent. Wde recruits Egg to the chromatin at target gene silencing loci, but their interaction is monoubiquitin-independent.
SetDB1 and Su(var)3-9 play non-overlapping roles in somatic cell chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster.

Dll functions in subdividing the thoracic limb primordium.
The development of the Drosophila leg requires both Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless (Wg), two signals that establish the proximo-distal (PD) axis by activating target genes such as Distalless.
These findings provide a complete and high-resolution fate map of the Drosophila appendage primordia, linking the primary domains to specific cis-regulatory elements in Dll.
disco plays a fundamental role in the Dll-dependent patterning of antenna and leg, perhaps as a regulator of Dll gene expression
studied a 17kb genomic region in the Dll locus which lies downstream of the coding sequence and found control elements of primary functional importance for the expression of Dll in the leg and in other tissues
The medial leg fates are established via a regulatory cascade in which Wg+Dpp activate Distalless and then Distalless directly activates dac, with Wg+Dpp as less critical, permissive inputs.
Hox proteins regulate Dll transcription in part by locally modifying chromatin structure at the Dll locus.
findings show a spot of dark pigment on fly wings emerged from assembly of a novel gene regulatory module in which a set of pigmentation genes evolved to respond to a common transcriptional regulator determining their spatial distribution; the primitive wing spot pattern subsequently diversified through changes in expression pattern of this regulator

Paternal restraint stress affects offspring metabolism via ATF-2 dependent mechanisms in Drosophila melanogaster germ cells.
DSC1 channels are expressed in both the central and the peripheral nervous system of adult Drosophila melanogaster.

A transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family member, painless, plays a role in low- and high-temperature responses.
The stinging sensation of isothiocyanate, the pungent ingredient of wasabi, is caused by activation of an evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway that is also used for nociception.
Abnormal nociceptive behavior of a mutant, painless, indicates that painless, a gene essential for nociception in Drosophila larvae, is also required for thermal nociception in adult flies.
We found that fructose potently elicited larval food-averse behaviors, and painless (pain), a transient receptor potential channel that is responsive to noxious stimuli, was required for the fructose response.
Painless protein is a direct sensor for noxious heat in Drosophila; Painless mediates a robust intracellular divalent calcium ion increase during heating as well as heat-evoked inward currents in whole-cell patch-clamp mode.
Our results suggest that Pain TRP channels expressed in cholinergic and/or GABAergic neurons are involved in female sexual receptivity.
Painless constitutes part of a mechanosensitive pathway that adjusts cardiac muscle activity to mechanical constraints.
results indicate that functions of painless in the adult central nervous system of Drosophila include modulation of olfactory processing and inhibition of male-male courtship behavior
in the case of Painless, ankryin repeats are important for thermal nociception but not for mechanical nociception

For the regulation of sexual receptivity through Pain TRP channels.
Recent work has uncovered the painless, mediating fly thermosensation.

Extramacrochaetae functions in dorsal-ventral patterning of Drosophila imaginal discs.
Notch signaling activates the expression of extramacrochaetae (emc), which encodes a helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor. Emc, in turn, then forms a biochemical complex with Da.
Daughterless level sets Emc protein levels in most cells, apparently by stabilizing Emc in heterodimers. Emc is destabilized in proneural regions by local competition for heterodimer formation by proneural bHLH proteins including Atonal or AS-C proteins.

INR signaling promotes glial phagocytic clearance of degenerating axons through regulation of Draper.
Glial clearance of damaged axons is significantly delayed in aged animals due to an age-dependent decline in translation of the critical glial recognition engulfment receptor Draper, which results from reduced phosphoinositide-3-kinase signalling.
This work identifies Draper-dependent activation of MMP-1 as a novel cascade required for proper glial clearance of severed axons.
The glial engulfment receptor Draper is protective in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's Disease.
During metamorphosis, Draper plays a critical role in apoptotic cell clearance by glia, whereas SIMU, which is mostly expressed in pupal macrophages outside the brain, is not involved in glial phagocytosis: Draper activates Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (dJNK) signaling predominantly in the ensheathing glia and astrocytes, where it is required for efficient removal of apoptotic neurons.
Spatial control of Draper receptor signaling initiates apoptotic cell engulfment.

Rap1 mediates Ras-independent activation of ERK signaling via the torso receptor tyrosine kinase in Drosophila embryos.
Data suggest that dPDZ-GEF/Rap1/Canoe signaling modulates cell shape and apicolateral cell constriction in embryonic and wing disc epithelia.
Rap1 acts through the effector Canoe to regulate these developmental processes.
The Rap1 is slightly enriched at the apical pole of metaphase/anaphase NBs and was found in a complex with atypical protein kinase C and Par6 in vivo.
Rap1 has a role in determining cell-type-specific morphologies in the developing wing epithelium. Rap1, with its effector Canoe, promotes symmetric distribution of DE-cadherin about the apicolateral circumference of epithelial cells.
Data indicate that Rap1 and Cno are required for proper organization of Baz into planar-polarized junctional belts.
Increased Rap1 activity restricts epithelial invagination in an alpha-catenin-dependent manner.
We show that Rap1 activity induces and/or maintains the formation of the apical domain of developing photoreceptor cells and that this event correlates with the apical accumulation and activity of SEV in presumptive R7 cells.
According to Bridges' map, all three bands (Dras1, Dras2, Dras3) were mapped to regions 85D, 64B, and 62B of chromosome 3. Among them, only Drasl has a common origin with ras genes of mammals.
Rap1 is activated to its GTP-bound form in response to Hh ligand, and that the GTPase exchange factor C3G likely contributes to this activation.
Gain-of-function studies using dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of Rap1 indicate that Rap1 contributes to axonal growth and guidance.
Rap1-interacting domains of Canoe mediate adherens junction and tricellular junction recruitment but are dispensable for membrane localization. Data also support a role for Canoe multimerization. These multifactorial inputs shape Canoe localization, correct Bazooka and adherens junction positioning, and thus apical-basal polarity.
the front/back polarity of border cells requires Rap1, hyperactivation of which disrupts cluster polarity and induces misoriented protrusions and loss of asymmetry in the actin network.
Rap1, Canoe and Mbt regulated epithelial morphogenesis by coupling stabilization of the adherens junction (AJ) protein E-Cadherin and Bazooka retention at the zonula adherens.
precisely regulated Rap1 activity reinforces connections between cells and polarizes the cluster, thus facilitating the coordinated collective migration of border cells.

Drosophila USP5 deletion phenotypes are caused by the activation of apoptosis and JNK pathway.
USP5 regulates ubiquitin homeostasis during Drosophila development.
work indicates that a primary physiological role of USP5 is not to recycle monoubiquitin for reutilization, but that it may involve disassembly of conjugated ubiquitin to maintain proteasome function.
Loss of Usp5 results in upregulation of Notch signaling and downregulation of RTK signaling by EGF receptor (EGFR) and Sevenless (Sev), leading to impaired photoreceptor development.
Thus, the deubiquitinase Leon maintains ubiquitin homeostasis and proper Ubiquilin levels, preventing postsynaptic proteins from accumulation to confine postsynaptic growth.
Studies indicate that knockdown of dGirdin in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc cells resulted in reduction of cell size and this was enhanced by half reduction of the Akt gene dose.

Hsp90 masks variation affecting target pathways and traits in populations independent of purely nongenetic sources of variation
heat shock inhibits eIF4F activity, and Hsp90 mRNA translation is sensitive to eIF4F inactivation
The results suggest that a multicomponent protein chaperone complex involving both Hsp90 and Hsp70 signals the cessation of heat shock protein synthesis, the restoration of normal translation, and likely the establishment of thermotolerance.
To determine the effect of Hsp90 on quantitative trait variability we deconstructed genetic, stochastic and environmental components of variation in traits of genetically matched flies, differing only by Hsp90 loss-of-function or wild-type alleles.

Piwi functions in Hsp90-mediated suppression of phenotypic variation

Armi is an essential component of the somatic piRNA pathway.
roles for the cytoplasmic Yb body components Armitage and Yb in somatic primary piRNA biogenesis
We conclude that transcripts bound by Armi and Yb are identified as piRNA precursors, resulting in localization to cytoplasmic processing granules and their subsequent engagement by the resident piRNA biogenesis machinery.
A heterologous RNA that lacks complementary piRNAs is processed into piRNAs upon recruitment of several piRNA pathway factors. This processing requires Zuc and the helicase Armitage (Armi).
These findings shed light on distinct and collaborative requirements of Yb and Armi in transposon-targeting piRNA biogenesis.
We propose that Armi shuttles between nuage and mitochondria, feeding precursor piRNAs generated by Ago3 cleavage into the Zucchini-dependent production of Aubergine- and Piwi-bound piRNAs on the mitochondrial surface.

AKH has a role in the regulation of starvation-induced foraging behavior
Loss of ppk28 increased neuronal glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH) signaling, and the AKH receptor was necessary for ppk28 mutant effects.
Akh is an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila
Data (including data from studies using transgenic flies) suggest that FoxO (forkhead box sub-group O) acts downstream of AKH (adipokinetic hormone) as transcription factor to mediate response to oxidative stress.
AKH signaling is required in insulin-producing cells for sugar-dependent Dilp3 release.
During adulthood, however, AKH regulates body fat content and the hemolymph sugar level as well as nutritional and oxidative stress responses. Finally, we provide evidence for a negative autoregulatory loop in Akh gene regulation.
Data (including data from studies using transgenic and mutant strains) suggest that Akh plays role in control of energy metabolism in this species; lipids appear to be main energy reserve during starvation; once glycogen stores are exhausted, carbohydrates are synthesized from other sources.

Pav-KLP transports elements of the actomyosin cytoskeleton
Results identify two modulators of the Wnt pathway, Tum and Pav, that have shared functions in cell division, which hints at a possible link between cytokinesis and Wnt activity during tumorigenesis.
Data show that Sticky (Sti), tile ring component Citron kinase (CIT-K) interacts directly with two kinesins, Nebbish and Pavarotti and that in turn these kinesins interact with each other and with another central spindle protein, Fascetto.
Study demonstrates the emerging role of centralspindlin (complex of two proteins Tum and Pav) in regulating cell migration and cell adhesion in addition to its previously known function during cytokinesis.
Depletion of Pav-KLP in neurons strongly stimulated kinesin-1-driven sliding of long microtubules and neurite outgrowth, while its ectopic overexpression in the cytoplasm blocked both of these processes.
Data show that GTPase-activating protein (Tum/RacGAP) is required for the motor activity of kinesin-6 motor (Pav/kinesin-6).
elevated expression of Pav-KLP underlies transport and plasticity phenotypes in pathway mutants, indicating that Toll-6-FoxO signaling promotes MT dynamics by limiting Pav-KLP expression.

microRNA regulation is a conserved feature of the Lin-28 gene in diverse animals.
Lin-28 is a stem cell intrinsic factor that boosts insulin signaling in intestinal progenitor cells and promotes their symmetric division in response to nutrients
Based on the analyses authors' current view is that LIN-28 is an essential component of an intestinal progenitor-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that modulates stem cell division type to adjust tissue growth to dietary conditions.
This FMRP activity is mediated solely via a second conserved RNA-binding protein, LIN-28, known to boost insulin signaling in stem cells. Via LIN-28, FMRP controls progenitor cell behavior by post-transcriptionally repressing the level of insulin receptor (InR).
Lin-28 does not block the production of let-7 in Drosophila, which suggests the let-7 independent pathway as a molecular mechanism of Lin-28

Expression of DnaJ-1 potently suppresses alpha1ACT-dependent degeneration , concomitant with decreased aggregation of the pathogenic protein. Mutating the nuclear importer karyopherin a3 also leads to reduced toxicity from pathogenic CACNA1A
Through DnaJ-1, our data connect ataxin-3 and Rad23 to protective processes involved with protein folding rather than increased turnover of toxic polyQ species.
Additional studies established that the increased toxicity upon mutating UbS2 stems from disrupting the autoprotective role that pathogenic ataxin-3 has against itself, which depends on the co-chaperone, DnaJ-1. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized balance between pathogenic and potentially therapeutic properties of the ataxin-3-Rad23 interaction; they highlight this interaction as critical for the toxicity of the S
our data indicate that the MLF/DnaJ-1-dependent increase in Lz level allows the repression of Notch expression and signaling to prevent aberrant blood cell development. Thus our findings establish a functional link between MLF and the co-chaperone DnaJ-1 to control RUNX transcription factor activity and Notch signaling during blood cell development in vivo.

DHR3 modulates dS6 kinase-dependent growth in Drosophila.
Data show that female Drosophila melanogaster undergo a dietary switch following mating and that S6 kinase and serotonin production are involved in this switch.

We find that the Drosophila UPRT homologue, krishah (kri), codes for an enzyme that is required for larval growth, pre-pupal/pupal viability and long-term adult lifespan.
These results strongly suggest that Mad2 is exclusively required to delay progression through early stages of prometaphase so that cells have time to fully engage the spindle assembly checkpoint.
Data show that the Mad2 kinetochore dimerization recruitment mechanism is conserved and that the recruitment of Cdc20 to kinetochores in Drosophila requires BubR1 but not Mad2.
Kinetochore localized Mad2 and Cdc20 is itself insufficient for triggering the mitotic checkpoint when Mps1 is low in Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts.
results show that the activity of Vn is controlled both positively and negatively, demonstrating the existence of additional levels at which Egfr signaling can be regulated

Here it is reported that bestrophin2 is a component of native Calcium channel at the plasma membrane
Study shows that Drosophila Vps8 is highly expressed in hemocytes and nephrocytes, and localizes to early endosomes despite the lack of a clear Vps3 homolog; Vps8 forms a complex and acts together with Vps16A, Dor/Vps18 and Car/Vps33A, and loss of any of these proteins leads to fragmentation of endosomes.
Here, the authors show that Vps8 overexpression inhibits homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS)-dependent trafficking routes including late endosome maturation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion, crinophagy and lysosome-related organelle formation. Mechanistically, Vps8 overexpression abolishes the late endosomal localization of HOPS-specific Vps41/Lt and prevents HOPS assembly.

Dfr/Vvl is highly expressed in a range of immunocompetent tissues, including the male ejaculatory duct, where its presence overlaps with and drives the expression of cecropin
Vvl is highly expressed in the prothoracic gland during embryogenesis and is enriched in the gland during larval development, suggesting that Vvl might function as a master transcriptional regulator in this tissue.
Grh and Vvl participate in a regulatory network controlling epithelial maturation.
Evidence suggests that Prat originated by gene duplication by retrotransposition of Prat2.

The roX1 and roX2 genes produce redundant, male-specific lethal transcripts required for targeting the MSL complex.
Nucleic acid binding determinants in the N terminus of MSL3 form an integrated domain which is required for interaction with MSL1 and localisation to X-chromosome.
Localization to the male X chromosome and transcriptional upregulation of X-linked genes are two separable functions of the MSL-3 protein.
Results suggest that the MSL complex (including MSL-1, -2, and -3) uses high-affinity sites to initially recognize the X chromosome and then associates with many of its targets through sequence-independent features of transcribed genes.
These results provide strong evidence for both sequence-dependent and -independent steps in MSL targeting of dosage compensation to the male X chromosome.
Using ChIP-chip analysis, the authors find that MSL3 chromodomain mutants retain binding to chromatin entry sites but show a clear disruption in the full pattern of MSL targeting in vivo, consistent with a loss of spreading.
A DNA-dependent interaction of MSL3 chromodomain with the H4 lysine20 monomethyl mark, was discovered.
MSL3 plays an important role in targeting the male specific lethal complex to chromatin in both humans and flies by binding to H4K20Me(1).

Lark is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and Hu-li Tai Shao localization during oogenesis.
RBM4 and Lark are the same protein, are localized in speckles and nucleoli, but can redistribute to perinucleolar clusters, consistent with a novel subnuclear pathway
LARK RNA-binding protein selectively regulates the circadian eclosion rhythm by controlling E74 protein expression
dFMRP interacts with a known clock output component, the LARK RNA-binding protein. LARK promotes the stability of dFMRP.
Results provide evidence that Dmoe RNA is a target of Lark during oogenesis and that it likely regulates either the splicing or translation of this RNA.
Data show that increased LARK expression during development dramatically alters the small LNv class of pigment-dispersing factor (PDF)-containing neurons with no obvious effects on the large LNv cells.
LARK is required in the Drosophila circadian system
LARK influences circadian period.

Enteric infection induces Lark-mediated intron retention at the 5' end of Drosophila genes.
CLN7 (and CLN3) are predominantly expressed in the glia that form the insect blood-brain-barrier.
Su(Hw) interacting factor CP190 largely overlapped with dCTCF binding sites and interacts with dCTCF. Binding of dCTCF to targets requires CP190
CTCF itself is critical for Fab-8 enhancer blocking.
CTCF plays more active roles in regulating gene activity and it functions differently from other insulator proteins in organizing the Drosophila genome.
CTCF in Drosophila functions in maintaining parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain as it does in mammals.
Data show that AGO2 interacts physically with CTCF and CP190, and depletion of either CTCF or CP190 results in genome-wide loss of AGO2 chromatin association.
CTCF aligns in the genome with Suppressor of Hairy wing and Boundary Element Associated Factor of 32 kDa at the borders of H3K27me3 domains.
Evolutionarily conserved ENY2 is responsible for barrier activity mediated by the dCTCF protein.
Results show that CP190 binds to CTCF or to other DNA binding insulator factors serving as a binding platform for compexes with enzymatic function, like NURF and dREAM.
TCF participates in the recruitment of Smad proteins to a subset of genomic sites and in the redistribution of these proteins in response to BMP signaling.
Drosophila CTCF-CP190 interactions are less critical for the in vivo functions of the CTCF protein than the N-terminal CTCF - CTCF interaction domain.
Mutation of the Mcp Pita site disrupts blocking activity and also eliminates dCTCF binding. In contrast, mutation of the Mcp dCTCF site does not affect Pita binding, and this mutant boundary retains partial function.
CTCF role in the decompaction of condensed bands in the Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes and replication timing
Results indicate that loss of Drosophila CTCF is not accompanied by widespread effects on gene expression, which may be due to redundant functions with other Insulator binding proteins.
N-terminal domain of the architectural protein CTCF has similar structural organization and ability to self-association in bilaterian organisms.
CTCF loss has limited effects on global genome architecture in Drosophila despite critical regulatory functions.

Our studies identify Akirin as a nuclear factor that genetically interacts with the BRM complex and is required for optimal expression of the Twist-dependent Dmef2 enhancer
Akirin orchestrates NF-kappaB transcriptional selectivity through the recruitment of the Osa-containing-SWI/SNF-like Brahma complex (BAP).
Hyd mediated Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of the NF-kappaB cofactor Akirin was required for efficient binding of Akirin to the NF-kappaB transcription factor Relish.
Akirin is critical for early tinman induction and subsequent formation of the heart in Drosophila melanogaster.
Rac1, Rac2 and Mtl, have overlapping functions in the control of epithelial morphogenesis, myoblast fusion, and axon growth and guidance

Rac2 has a central role in regulating the Drosophila homeostatic system.
Balboa (also known as CG8546, ppk26) and PPK physically interact and likely form a functional ion channel. Both genes are functionally required for mechanical nociception and show very specific enrichment and expression in the class IV nociceptor neurons.
Ppk26, a member of the trimeric degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) family, is necessary for proper locomotion behavior in Drosophila larvae in a mutually dependent fashion with coexpressed Ppk1.
PPK26 and PPK might form heteromeric DEG/ENaC channels that are essential for mechanotransduction in class IV da neurons.
Dendrite pruning requires the developmentally regulated degradation of the cell adhesion molecule Neuroglian, and loss of Rab11 causes defects in the developmental degradation of Neuroglian and another target, the ion channel Ppk26.
larval translucida acts in the extracellular space where it completes a novel auto-regulatory loop that modulates BMP activity[larval translucida]
By deubiquitinating Lqf, which enhances the efficiency of Delta internalization, Faf stimulates Delta signaling
Epsin may be essential for Delta/Serrate/Lag2 signaling because it targets mono-ubiquitinated DSL proteins to an endocytic recycling compartment that they must enter to be converted into active ligands
epsin plays a specific, evolutionarily conserved role to promote Notch signaling during animal development
both Dmib and Epsin are required in these cells for some of the endocytic events that internalize DSL ligands
Lqf plays distinct roles in two ubiquitin pathways to regulate structural and functional plasticity of the synapse
Lqf is essential to the receptor-mediated endocytosis of larval serum proteins (LSPs) in the larval fat body cells of Drosophila.
All of the data were consistent with a model where Epsin's essential function is to link ubiquitinated Notch ligands to Clathrin-coated vesicles through other Clathrin adapter proteins.
DSL ligands activate Notch by inducing proteolytic cleavage of the receptor ectodomain that requires ligand to be endocytosed in signal-sending cells by the adaptor protein Epsin; results suggest that once ligand binds receptor, activation depends on a competition between Epsin-mediated ligand endocytosis, which induces cleavage, and transendocytosis of the ligand by the receptor, which aborts the incipient signal.

The N-terminus of Orb2A not only promotes the formation of fibrils, but also forms the fibril core.
Authors posit that pasilla-mediated processing of unspliced Orb2A mRNA integrates experience and internal state to control Orb2A protein abundance and long-term memory formation.
Study showed that the N-terminus specific to Orb2A can bind to lipid membranes; binding occurs preferentially to curved membranes and requires the membranes to be negatively charged. When binding to lipid membranes, the N-terminus of Orb2A undergoes a transition from a dynamic, intrinsically disordered state to a less dynamic alpha-helix. This lipid membrane interaction can prevent the N-terminus from forming amyloid f...
Data confirm the original hypothesis that the glutamine, histidine-rich (Q/H-rich) domain of Orb2 can bind to transition metals via its His residues. Hence, the Q/H rich domain behaves like other H-rich domains, most of which were shown to be metal binding domains.
We present here evidences of a novel genetic mechanism to regulate synapse fine tuning during development and propose an equilibrium between Orb2 conformational state and nervous system formation.

In Drosophila, the PAN GU (PNG) triggers translation of SMAUG (SMG), a multifunctional posttranscriptional regulator conserved from yeast to humans.
Data show that Smaug can recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylase to trigger Hsp83 mRNA degradation despite the fact that it is being translated.
Smaug accumulation thus coordinates progression through the maternal-to-zygotic transition
This paper reports that the Smaug recognition elements in the 3' UTR of nanos (nos) mRNA govern the time- and ATP-dependent assembly of an exceedingly stable repressed ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) in embryo extract.
Smaug directly recruits Ago1 to nanos mRNA in a miRNA-independent manner, thereby repressing translation.

Results indicate that the ability of faf, hiw or Rdl to modulate sleep and protect against cognitive impairments during waking is circuit dependent. Decreasing hiw and Rdl within the Mushroom Bodies protects against the negative effects of sleep deprivation as indicated by the absence of a subsequent homeostatic response, or deficits in short-term memory.

KLP67A is essential for spindle assembly during mitosis and male meiosis
Hypomorphic mutations of klp67A may lead to segregation defects
Klp67A is a member of the Kip3 subfamily of microtubule destabilising kinesins, the loss of which results in abnormally long and stable pre-anaphase microtubules
The data reveal that, unlike other metazoan kinesin-8 proteins, Klp67A binds the nascent prophase and mature metaphase kinetochore. From this location, Klp67A uses its motor activity to ensure chromosome alignment and proper spindle length.
Results suggest that KLP67A plays an important role in controlling the dynamics of microtubule (MT) plus ends to limit MT polymerization thereby preventing the plus ends from extending far enough to reach the opposite pole.

Drosophila enhancer of Zeste/ESC complexes have a histone H3 methyltransferase activity that marks chromosomal Polycomb sites
We purified an ESC-E(Z) complex from Drosophila embryos and found four major subunits: ESC, E(Z), NURF-55, and the PcG repressor, SU(Z)12. A recombinant complex reconstituted from these four subunits methylates lysine-27 of histone H3.
ESC and E(Z) are present in multiple distinct complexes that undergo dynamic changes during development
The nucleosome-binding subunits Su(z)12 and Nurf55 anchor the E(z) enzyme on chromatin substrates, an essential process in maintaining HOX gene silencing during development.
one of the roles of ESC (and ESCL and EED) in Polycomb repressive complex 2 complexes is to enable E(Z) to utilize histone H3 as a substrate by physically linking enzyme and substrate
A Pcl-PSC2 complex is the histone methyltransferase that generates the high levels of histone3-lysine27 trimethylation in Polycomb target genes that are needed to maintain a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state.
These results suggest that increased H3K27 trimethylation activity of E(Z)(Trm) causes the premature accumulation of H3K27me3 in early embryogenesis, "predestining" initially active Polycomb target genes to silencing once Polycomb silencing is initiated.
The emerging picture presents PRC2 as a cooperative multipart machine, intricately outfitted to sense and respond to the local chromatin environment and other cues[review]

JIL-1 may exert such effects by a general regulation of chromatin structure affecting gene expression
The JIL-1 kinase regulates the structure of Drosophila polytene chromosomes.
JIL-1 kinase is required to maintain nuclear morphology and integrity of nurse cells during oogenesis; this function may be linked to molecular interactions with lamin Dm0.
Proper dosage compensation of eye pigment levels in males controlled by X-linked white alleles requires normal JIL-1 function.
JIL-1 functions in vivo in a pathway that includes Su(var)3-9, which is a major catalyst for dimethylation of the histone H3K9 residue, HP1 recruitment, and the formation of silenced heterochromatin.
JIL-1 and Chromator interact in an interband-specific complex that functions to establish or maintain polytene chromosome structure in Drosophila.
The gain of function allele is a suppressor strongly supporting a functional role for JIL-1 in maintaining euchromatic chromatin and counteracting heterochromatic spreading and gene silencing.
that a reduced level of histone H4 acetylated at Lys12 by ATAC attenuates histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser10 by JIL-1 owing to reduced binding of JIL-1 to hypoacetylated chromatin.

JIL-1 participates in a complex histone modification network that characterises active, decondensed chromatin
A balance between euchromatic (JIL-1) and heterochromatic [SU(var)2-5 and SU(var)3-9] factors regulates position-effect variegation in Drosophila.
Structural contributions from the JIL-1 protein are unlikely to play a role in counteracting heterochromatic spreading and gene silencing in position-effect variegation.
JIL-1 and phosphoacetylated H3 histone are found at enhancers genome-wide prior to activation of transcription
JIL-1 loss-of-function alleles can act either as an enhancer or indirectly as a suppressor of w(m4) position-effect variegation depending on the precise levels of JIL-1 kinase activity.
JIL-1 and Z4 (also known as Putzig), which are necessary for establishing a fine-tuned regulation of the transcription of the major component of Drosophila telomeres, the HeT-A retrotransposon, thus guaranteeing genome stability
The results suggest that JIL-1 is not a histone H3S28 kinase and that it is not involved in 14-3-3 recruitment in Drosophila.
epigenetic H3S10 phosphorylation mark itself functions as a causative regulator of chromatin structure independently of any structural contributions from the JIL-1 protein.
results strongly suggest that the action of JIL-1 depends on which telomere domain, which chromosome and which promoter is embedded in the telomere chromatin.
JIL-1 regulated heterochromatin in the context of the chromocenter and fourth chromosome by creating a composite H3S10phK9me2 mark together with the Su(var)3-9 methyltransferase.
Enrichment of JIL-1 and the H3S10ph mark are predominantly associated with active genes in Drosophila.
our data indicate that the conserved H3S28 residue in metazoans has a role in supporting PRC2 catalysis.

DPTP69D has a role in axon outgrowth in Drosophila
indicate that mutations in Ptp69D resulting in axon guidance defects and lethality significantly compromise catalytic activity
Ptp69D is expressed only on the innermost core fibers during development of the larval mushroom body; it regulates segregation of young axons into a single core bundle.
Mutations in the first Ig and catalytic domains disrupt synaptic terminal growth. PTP69D role in terminal growth is mechanistically distinct from axon targeting.

CrebA deficiency leads to ER stress upon bacterial challenge
Data suggest that CrebA is involved in regulation of infection tolerance in this species; expression of CrebA is regulated in the fat body upon infection; CrebA is required to survive infection and promotes tolerance of bacterial infection; CrebA deficiency leads to ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress upon bacterial challenge.
Loss of CrebA also partially suppresses mHtt effects on behavior and cell loss and restoration of CrebA can suppress Atx2 effects. Our results indicate a prominent role of Atx2 in mediating mHtt pathology, specifically via its regulation of CrebA, defining a novel molecular pathway in Huntington's disease pathogenesis.
CrebA increases secretory capacity through direct transcriptional regulation of the secretory machinery, a subset of secretory cargo, and other key regulators.

Simultaneous absence of neuralized and mib1 completely abolishes Notch signaling in both lateral inhibition (generating single neural precursors from a field of equipotent cells)and wing dorsoventral boundary formation.
The ubiquitylation of Delta by both Neuralized and Mindbomb1 was detected, with the two enzymes using distinct docking sites and having different acceptor lysine preferences.
While deficient Mib1 signaling leads to overgrowth of the NMJ, ubiquitous overexpression of Mib1 results in a reduction in the number of presynaptic motor neuron boutons and branches
The authors found that Dl requires ubi for its full function, but can also signal in two ubi-independent modes, one dependent and one independent of Neur. Their analysis suggests that one important role of Dl protein ubiquitination by Mib1 is their release from cis-inhibitory interactions with Notch, enabling them to trans-activate Notch on adjacent cells.
Wingful (wf) encodes a potent extracellular feedback inhibitor of Wg. In contrast to the cytoplasmic protein Naked cuticle (Nkd), the only known Wg feedback antagonist, Wf functions during larval stages.

notum can cleave mammalian glypticans and GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface.
the long-range activity of Hedgehog is regulated in the apical extracellular space by the glypican Dally and the hydrolase Notum
Hydrolysis of the Dally-GPI by Notum provides a switch from low to high level signalling by promoting internalisation of the Hh-Patched ligand-receptor complex.
Notum requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signalling, but does not cleave their glycophosphatidylinositol anchor; structural analyses reveal glycosaminoglycan binding sites on Notum, which probably help Notum to co-localize with Wnt proteins
Notum normally functions to coordinate synaptic structural and functional differentiation via negative regulation of Wg trans-synaptic signaling in the extracellular synaptomatrix.

epithelial tube size regulation defines new non-apoptotic roles for Yki, DIAP1 and Ice
Ubr3 interacts with DIAP1 and positively regulates DIAP1 activity, possibly by maintaining its active conformation in the apoptosis pathway.
DIAP1 contains distinct instability motifs that regulate inhibitor-of-apoptosis turnover and apoptotic consequences.
Both germline and somatic stem cells in the adult Drosophila testis are more resistant to apoptosis-inducing stimuli than their differentiating daughters. Niche signaling causes enhanced expression of DIAP1 in both germline stem cells and somatic cyst stem cells, and the resistance to apoptosis is mediated, at least in part, by this enhanced expression.

Study finds that C-terminal fragments of the Wg receptor DFz2 accumulate in nuclear foci in association with large RNA granules localizing to the space between the inner & and outer nuclear membranes; granules are found at of inner membrane invaginations, are bounded by LamC, and can be seen leaving the nucleus.
The heterotrimeric G protein Go functions as a transducer of Wingless-Frizzled 2 signaling in the synapse and Ankyrin 2 as a target of Go signaling required for neuromuscular junction formation
Maturation of a central brain flight circuit in Drosophila requires Fz2 and Ca2+ signaling.
cells located outside the reach of extracellular Wg depend on the Frizzled2 receptor to maintain signaling. Frizzled2 expression is increased in the absence of Wg secretion and is required to maintain signaling and cell survival in NRT-wg wing discs.
Rept and pontin have conserved their ability to bind to Myc during evolution
Drosophila Reptin participates in epigenetic processes leading to a repressive chromatin state.
The enzymatic functions of Rept and Pont are indispensable for maintaining Hox gene expression states, highlighting the importance of these two antagonistic factors in transcriptional output.
WAC promotes the interaction between TTT and Pontin/Reptin in an energy-dependent manner, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity by facilitating mTORC1 dimerization and mTORC1-Rag interaction

Pipe induces ventral cell fates in the embryo via activation of the Spatzle/Toll pathway.
Pipe acts as a sulfotransferase
promotes 6-O- and/or N-sulfation of heparan sulfate but is not required for heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfation
no requirement for nudel to be expressed in ventral, pipe-expressing follicle cells
Sulfation of eggshell components by Pipe defines dorsal-ventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo.
Data indicate that differences in functional specificity, and presumably enzymatic specificity, are associated with several of the Pipe isoforms.
observation suggests a mechanism in which the sulfated target of Pipe promotes a productive interaction between Snake and Easter, perhaps by facilitating conformational changes in a complex containing the two proteins
Snake activation is cascade-dependent but pipe-independent. Snake's activation of Easter is the first spatially regulated step in the dorsoventral protease cascade.
Pipe modifies proteins that are incorporated in the ventral eggshell and activate Toll signaling which in turn initiates embryonic dorsoventral patterning.
findings show that Mirror (Mirr), a homeodomain transcription factor induced by EGFR signaling in DA follicle cells, directly represses pipe expression by binding to a conserved element in the pipe regulatory region
dCHD3 exists as a monomer
Brv1 forms a mechanosensitive cation channel.  Brv1 amplifies the touch response of NOMPC.
we found that the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel brivido-1 (brv1) is required for these behavioral shifts. Our Drosophila model will allow us to precisely identify the genes and circuits involved in cold nociceptive sensitization.
Data show that SIDL is expressed primarily in the nervous system, co-localizes with GFP-Shal channels in neurons, and interacts specifically with the LL-motif of Drosophila and mouse Shal channels.
In Drosophila, the single Shal/K(v)4 gene encodes the predominant I(A) current in many neuronal cell bodies.
The loss of Shal potassium channel induces compensatory rebalancing of ion channel expression.
We found that ddaE neurons have an axonal diffusion barrier proximal to the cell body that requires a giant isoform of the neuronal ankyrin Ank2. Furthermore, the potassium channel shal concentrates in the proximal axon in an Ank2-dependent manner
Study identified that Shal/Kv4, a well known voltage-gated K+ channel, acts as a controller of wake-sleep transition at dusk in Drosophila circadian neurons.
implication that ASH1 is required for essentially all H3-K4 methylation that occurs in vivo
lysine to arginine substitution of histone H3 at position 36 abolished the methyltransferase activity of Drosophila ASH1, suggesting that K36 is their specific target
Physical interaction of ASH1 with FSH activates global transcription.
loss of ASH1 significantly decreases H3K36 dimethylation, providing further evidence that ASH1 is an H3K36 dimethylase in vivo.
If ASH1 or TRX function is lost or reduced, heterochromatin can spread into these domains creating a sink that diverts heterochromatic proteins from other variegating locations, which then may express a suppressed phenotype.
Mrg15 is a subunit of the Ash1 complex, a stimulator of Ash1 enzymatic activity and a critical regulator of the TrxG protein function of Ash1 in Drosophila.
Ash1 HMTase activity is activated by MRG15, a subunit of the identified Ash1 complex, and that this complex, rather than the Ash1 protein alone, is the active form of this H3K36 methyltransferase, both in vitro and in vivo.
Trx, Ash1, and CBP proteins are required for the correct chromosome segregation and that Ash1 and CBP mediate for Cid/CENP-A recruitment at centromeres through post-translational histone modifications.  Centromeric H3 histone is consistently acetylated in K27 by CBP and that nej and ash1 silencing respectively causes a decrease in H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 methylation along with an impairment of Cid loading.
TAF6 in flies is restricted to TFIID (TATA binding protein)

Structure of a specific alcohol-binding site defined by the odorant binding protein LUSH from Drosophila melanogaster
LUSH, a soluble odorant-binding protein, undergoes a major conformational change, triggered by ligands.
genetic interaction between lush and spontaneous activity in 11-cis vaccenyl acetate-sensitive neurons in the absence of pheromone
Detection of odorants by olfactory neurons is results from direct activation of odorant receptors by odor molecules; study shows that detection of the 11-cis vaccenyl acetate (cVA), is instead mediated by pheromone-induced conformational shifts in LUSH.
the alcohol binding in the LUSH protein is the consequence of three important factors: H-bonding, solvation, and the other noncovalent interaction.
the ligand-binding cavity of LUSH protein can accommodate a variety ligands and pheromones with strong binding interactions

dASF1 has a direct role in modifying chromatin structure during DNA replication and this function of dASF1 is important for the processivity of the replication machinery.
Asf1 is directed via interactions with sequence-specific complexes to mediate silencing of specific target genes.
Histone chaperones ASF1 and NAP1 differentially modulate removal of active histone marks by LID-RPD3 complexes during NOTCH silencing.
ASF1 cellular levels are tightly controlled by distinct pathways and provide a molecular mechanism for post-translational regulation of dASF1 and hASF1a by TLK kinases.
DLP and ASF1 are part of a predeposition complex, which is recruited by XNP and is necessary to prevent DNA exposure in the nucleus.
ASF1 is critically required to load H3.3-H4 dimers on the HIRA complex prior to histone deposition on paternal DNA. This separation of tasks could optimize the rapid assembly of paternal chromatin within the gigantic volume of the egg cell. In contrast, ASF1 is surprisingly dispensable for the amplification of cleavage nuclei, although chromatin integrity is likely compromised in asf1 knocked-down embryos.
Wallenda is both necessary for highwire synaptic overgrowth and sufficient to promote synaptic overgrowth, and synaptic levels of Wallenda protein are controlled by Highwire and ubiquitin hydrolases.
The regulation of Wnd protein turnover by Hiw can function as a damage surveillance mechanism for responding to axonal injury.
Wnd regulates an adaptive response to injury that allows neurons to cope with axonal stress.
The dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) signaling pathway in Drosophila, which consists of Highwire and Wallenda and controls axonal growth, regeneration, and degeneration, is also involved in dendritic growth in vivo.
The results of this study indicated that Wnd regulates multiple independent pathways in Drosophila motoneurons and that JIP1 scaffolds a specific downstream cascade required for the organization of presynaptic microtubules during synaptic development.
DLK is not essential for dendrite regeneration.
our study in Drosophila has uncovered a novel physiological function for Wnd in modulating cell invasion
Here the authors identify the Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK, Wnd in Drosophila) as a critical target and effector of cAMP in injured axons.
Wallenda/DLK protein levels are temporally downregulated by Tramtrack69 to allow R7 growth cones to become stationary boutons
These studies at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction indicate that many synaptic defects in unc-104-null mutants are mediated independently of Unc-104's transport function, via the Wallenda (Wnd)/DLK MAP kinase axonal damage signaling pathway.

Results suggest that Tey determines target specificity by repressing the expression of Toll; these results reveal a mechanism for generating synaptic specificity that relies on the negative regulation of a repulsive target cue.
Serpentine (serp) and Vermiform (verm) encode similar proteins with an LDL-receptor ligand binding motif and chitin binding and deacetylation domains and are required for the normal fibrillar structure of chitin.
DmCDA1 (Serpentine, Serp) and DmCDA2 (Vermiform, Verm) have distinct functions during Drosophila adult wing cuticle differentiation. Chitosan staining revealed that Serp is the major enzyme responsible for chitin deacetylation during wing cuticle formation, while Verm does not seem to be needed for this process. Indeed, it is questionable whether Verm is a chitin deacetylase at all.
Serpentine (serp) and Vermiform (verm) encode similar proteins with an LDL-receptor ligand binding motif and chitin binding and deacetylation domains and are required for the normal fibrillar structure of chitin.

we find that EGFR regulates the apical determinant Crb and the extracellular matrix regulator Serp, two factors previously known to control tube length. EGFR regulates the organisation of endosomes in which Crb and Serp proteins are loaded
DmCDA1 (Serpentine, Serp) and DmCDA2 (Vermiform, Verm) have distinct functions during Drosophila adult wing cuticle differentiation. Chitosan staining revealed that Serp is the major enzyme responsible for chitin deacetylation during wing cuticle formation, while Verm does not seem to be needed for this process. Indeed, it is questionable whether Verm is a chitin deacetylase at all.

phosphatidylethanolamine, the major phospholipid in Drosophila, controls the release of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) from Drosophila cell membranes, exerting feedback control on the synthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids
Larvae have an alternative cleavage mechanism for producing transcriptionally active dSREBP, and this permits survival of dS2P mutants.
sterol regulatory element-binding protein is activated by the caspase Drice in Drosophila larvae
dScap and dS2P, essential components of the SREBP activation machinery in mammalian cells, are dispensable in Drosophila owing to different compensatory mechanisms.
TORC1-SREBP serves to integrate signals promoting growth and G1-S progression in order to maintain enodplasmic reticulum function during cell proliferation.
During the larval-pupal transition, the levels of CDK8 inversely correlate with the activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein.
The dendrite simplification in srebp mutant nociceptive neurons is accompanied by hypersensitivity of srebp mutant larvae to noxious stimuli.
constitutive activation of the TOR-pathway target and lipogenesis factor Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) also resulted in GSC loss, whereas inhibition of SREBP rescued GSC loss triggered by depletion of dMfn.
each Imp-alpha protein carries during Drosophila spermatogenesis distinct, albeit overlapping, functions that may involve nuclear import of proteins, microtubule organisation, and other yet unknown processes
Drosophila alpha1 performs paralog-specific activities that are essential for gametogenesis and regulation of subcellular alpha1 localization may affect cell fate decisions.
This is supported by attenuated interaction of IMPa1 with TIM carrying a mutation previously shown to prevent nuclear entry of TIM and PER.
This study identified a potential nuclear localization signal at the N-terminal end of Yorkie as well as a critical role for Importin alpha 1 in Yorkie nuclear import.
Here we examined the consequences of loss of clock function on reproductive fitness in Drosophila melanogaster with mutated period (per(0)), timeless (tim(0)), cycle (cyc(0)), and Clock (Clk(Jrk)) genes
Stress response genes protect against lethal effects of sleep deprivation in Drosophila
cycle regulates rest and life span in male Drosophila
findings suggest that Clockwork Orange (CWO) acts preferentially in the late night to help terminate CLK-CYC-mediated transcription of direct target genes including cwo itself
Cwo is rhythmically expressed and directly regulated by CLK-CYC through canonical E-box sequences.
Study shows that rhythmic transcription of per and tim involves time-of-day-specific binding of CLK-CYC and associated cycles in chromatin modifications.
a role of CYCLE in the post-translational regulation of the CLOCK protein.
findings show that Clk and cyc act during starvation to modulate the conflict of whether flies sleep or search for food
Computational dissection of CLK/CYC context-specific binding sites reveals sequence motifs for putative partner factors, which are predictive for individual binding sites
Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) antagonizes CLK-CYC E-box binding, thus enhancing the removal of CLK-CYC from E-boxes to maintain transcriptional repression. This process requires PER, which suggests that PER-TIM and CWO cooperate to maintain a transcriptionally repressed state by removing CLK-CYC from E-boxes
experiments define the genetic architecture required to initiate circadian clock function in Drosophila, reveal mechanisms governing circadian activator stability that are conserved in perhaps all eukaryotes, and suggest that Clk, cyc, and cry expression is sufficient to drive clock expression in naive cells
There is higher Period and Timeless and lower Cycle expression in the muscle of strains with delayed aging compared to the parental strain.

DEAF-1 is a regulator of Drosophila immunity; it activates the expression of Mtk and Drs promoter.
trc is regulated by phosphorylation and interacts with fry during wing hair development.
biochemical and genetic evidence for the tumour suppressor kinase Hippo (Hpo) as an upstream regulator of Wts and Trc for dendrite maintenance and tiling, respectively
Sin1, Rictor, Trc and target of rapamycin (TOR), components of the TOR complex 2 (TORC2), are required for dendritic tiling of class IV da neurons
Mutations in trc and wts genes lead to changes in cell shape, cellular levels of F-actin, the timing of differentiation, and the expression of multiple wing hairs and DE-Cadherin.
Full length Fry and Trc show only partial co-localization in growing bristles while an amino terminal fragment of Fry shows close to complete co-localization with Trc suggests that the interaction between these proteins is transient and regulated.
Data show that Tricornered Kinase (Trc) regulates the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) levels largely, by regulating the transcription of WASP.
The regulation of Warts conformation by Mats, Fat/Dachsous signaling, and Dachs appears independent of Warts phosphorylation by Hippo kinase, establishing a precedent for the control of Nuclear Dbf2-related kinases

chromodomains are DNA binding modules important for ATP-dependent nucleosome mobilization
Drosophila Mi-2 negatively regulates dDREF by inhibiting its DNA-binding activity.
results reveal a potential mechanism for regulation of the dMi-2 enzyme and point toward CK2 phosphorylation as a common feature of CHD family ATPases
Results suggest that Drosophila Mi-2/NuRD complex functions in neuronal differentiation through the repression of proneural gene expression by chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation.
The results suggest that dMi-2 distribution over active heat shock genes are determined by transcriptional activity.
dMi-2 is an important regulator of both chromosome condensation and cohesin binding in interphase cells.
EcR and dMi-2 form a complex that is devoid of Ultraspiracle. Unexpectedly, EcR contacts the dMi-2 ATPase domain and increases the efficiency of dMi-2-mediated nucleosome remodelling
Genetic experiments in Drosophila demonstrate that expression of cancer-derived dMi-2 mutants misregulates differentiation of epithelial wing structures and produces phenotypes that correlate with their nucleosome remodelling properties.
Mi-2/NuRD complex protects stem cell progeny from mitogenic Notch signaling.
Results of genetic interaction analyses revealed that Mi-2 and Caf1/p55, components of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, genetically antagonize the role of DREF in germline stem cell maintenance. Taken together, these data suggest that DREF contributes to intrinsic components of the germline stem cell regulatory network that maintains competence to self-renew.
The Mi-2 nucleosome remodeler and the Rpd3 histone deacetylase are involved in piRNA-guided heterochromatin formation.

Flightin is a major contributor to myofilament stiffness and a key determinant of the enhanced delayed force response to stretch in Drosophila flight muscles.
Results illustrate the importance of flightin in flight muscle development and function.
Myofilin is probably needed for filament assembly in all muscles, and flightin for stability of flight muscle thick filaments in adult flies
used atomic force microscopy to study the morphological and mechanical properties of fully hydrated native thick filaments isolated from indirect flight muscle of normal and mutants lacking flightin
COOH terminus of flightin is necessary for normal myofilament lattice organization, thereby facilitating the cross-bridge binding required to achieve high power output for flight.

Vesicular transport mediates the uptake of cytoplasmic proteins into mitochondria in Drosophila melanogaster.
fat-like gene of Drosophila is involved in the formation of tubular organs
Fat2 is required for the planar polarity of actin filament orientation at the basal side of ovarian follicle cells
Planar polarized localization of Fat2 depends on intact microtubules.Microtubule polarity depends on the atypical cadherin Fat2.
Concordant microtubule polarity, but not microtubule alignment, requires the atypical cadherin Fat2, which acts at an early stage to translate plus-end bias into coordinated actin-mediated collective cell migration.
Fat2/Lar signaling mediates short-range communication between neighboring cells instead of transmitting long-range information across a tissue.
Data show that the atypical cadherin Fat2 directs and orchestrates transmission of the intracellular actomyosin asymmetry cue onto a tissue plane and facilitate epithelial rotation in the opposite direction.
this study demonstrated that a member of the newly discovered ionotropic glutamate receptor (IR) family, IR76b, functioned in the detection of low salt and was a Na(+) channel.
In the olfactory system IR76b mediates the long-range attraction to the odor.
IR25a and IR76b are essential in sour gustatory receptor neurons of females for oviposition preference on acid-containing food.
Our work extends the physiological implications of Ir76b from low-Na(+) attraction to high-Na(+) aversion, prompting further investigation of the physiological mechanisms that modulate two competing components of Na(+)-evoked gustation coded in heterogeneous Ir76b-positive GRNs.
Mutation in IR76b gene is associated with loss of appetitive behavioral responses to fatty acids.

Tsc2 mutants showed a dramatic decrease in the levels of phosphorylated Akt, and interestingly, Akt mutants phenocopied Tsc2 mutants, leading to the hypothesis that Tsc2 and Akt might work via the same genetic pathway to regulate synapse growth.
deregulation of TORC1 induces activation of JNK, indicate that multiple cellular stresses are induced and contribute to the synthetic-lethal interactions between RB and TSC1/TSC2 inactivation.
hyperactivation of TORC1 following the loss of TSC1/2 is detrimental to stem cell maintenance and multiple lineage differentiation in the Drosophila intestinal stem cell lineage, a mechanism that could be conserved in other stem cell lineages

Golden Goal (Gogo) regulates axon-axon interactions and axon-target interactions in R8 photoreceptor axons.
Gogo both positively and negatively regulates Hts that affects the Actin-Spectrin cytoskeleton in growth cone filopodia, thereby guiding photoreceptor axons.

Data show that a conserved Tyr-Tyr-Asp (YYD) tripeptide motif in the Gogo cytoplasmic domain is required for photoreceptor axon targeting.
Gogo contributes to retinotopic map formation in the Drosophila lamina by controlling the distribution of R1-R6 axon fascicles.
The cytoplasmic part of Gogo is required for its function in dendritic tree formation, suggesting that Gogo conveys information from extracellular cues to intracellular molecules that control dendrite development.

results reveal that the Feo/Klp3A complex is necessary for Polo recruitment to the spindle midzone; data imply that Polo recruitment to the central spindle is not required for furrowing, but some other aspect of cytokinesis
Polo directly phosphorylates Partner of Numb (Pon), an adaptor protein for Numb, and this phosphorylation event is important for Pon to localize Numb
These results indicate that Gwl activity antagonizes Polo and thus identify an important regulatory interaction of the cell cycle.
suggest a model in which the eventual activation of Cdc25 by an excess of Polo at stage 13 triggers nuclear envelope breakdown and entry into prometaphase
The depletion of Polo results in a strong prometa/metaphase arrest with the spindle checkpoint activated in response to lack of tension

Cdk1 phosphorylates the conserved centriole protein Sas-4 during mitosis. This creates a Polo-docking site that helps recruit Polo to daughter centrioles.
Polo is composed of an N-term kinase domain (KD) and a C-term polo-box domain (PBD), which regulates its subcellular localizations. PBD binding to the KD masks a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Activating phosphorylation of the KD leads to exposure of the NLS and entry of Polo into the nucleus before nuclear envelope breakdown.
three N-terminal POLO phosphorylation sites that are critical for CNB function in neuroblasts are dispensable for spermatogenesis. Our results underpin the multifunctional nature of CNB that plays different roles in different cell types in Drosophila, and they identify CNB as an essential component for C-tubule assembly and flagellum development in Drosophila spermatogenesis
These observations identify Plk1/Polo kinase regulation of Sas-4 as essential for efficient pericentriolar material expansion.
Results identified a conserved upstream sequence element (USE) close to the polo proximal poly(A) signal. Its deletion causes developmental defects in flies and incorrect polo mRNA 3'-end formation, expression, and cell cycle progression.

Data indicate that interphase centrioles are closely associated with Sas-4, Spd-2, Polo kinase, Pericentrin-like protein (Dplp), Asterless (Asl), Plk4 kinase, Centrosomin (Cnn) and gamma-tubulin.
Asl is not incorporated into daughter centrioles as they assemble during S phase but is only incorporated once mother and daughter separate at the end of mitosis.
Asl not only targets Plk4 to centrioles but also modulates Plk4 stability and activity, explaining the ability of overexpressed Asl to drive centriole amplification.
ana1 mutants lack detectable centrosomes in vivo, that Ana1 is irreversibly incorporated into centrioles during their assembly and appears to play a more important role in maintaining Asl at centrioles than in initially recruiting Asl to centrioles...the N-terminal region of Ana1 (amino acids 1-935) is required to target Ana1 to centrioles through a direct interaction with Cep135, whereas the C-terminal region of Ana1.
By halfway through pupal life, the centriole number decreases and structural defects, ranging from being incomplete or lacking B-tubules, are detected. Asl, Ana1 and Sas-4 are still present, suggesting that the centriole integrity does not depend on these proteins.

selects different DNA sequences in regulating downstream target genes
The EDG84A gene encoding pupal cuticle protein is one of the targets of ecdysteroid-inducible transcription factor betaFTZ-F1 and is expressed only in anterior epidermis of the body during mid- to late prepupal period.
DHR3 and betaFTZ-F1 activate the EDG84A gene in a redundant manner.  The temporal expression of the EDG84A gene is mainly controlled by betaFTZ-F1 but that the binding of DHR3 is also important.

Study shows that the LASCY, DYTQL, NANGE motifs, and the C-terminal domain of SCR mediate suppression of induction of ectopic proboscis identity, which would explain why co-expression of PB and SCR is unable to induce ectopic proboscises.
We also found that a base-mismatch can enable Loqs-PB to tune miRNA length. We speculate that Loqs-PB tunes miRNA length by changing the conformation of base-mismatched nucleotides in the pre-miRNA stem to that of base-matched ones.
role of the highest activity of the BMP gradient is to activate zen
Mutational analysis shows that the number of Smad- and Zen-binding sites is essential for the C15 transcriptional response, and the spatial limits of C15 expression are established through a repression mechanism in the dorsolateral cells of the embryo.

Bcd drives precise and sharp expression of its target genes through a process that depends exclusively on its ability to activate transcription.
the accelerated rate of evolution observed for bcd is owing, at least partly, to variation generated by relaxed selective constraint

Target gene positioning involves combinatorial interactions that are mediated by the binding site architecture of each gene's cis-regulatory elements.
activating and repressive effects of Bcd and Cic, respectively, are integrated by the Bcd target gene enhancer
The precision of Bcd target genes for embryos with a single, double or quadruple dose of bicoid demonstrating that precision is highest at mid-embryo and position dependent, rather than gene dependent, is presented.
The data helping to understand how anterior patterning is achieved under the control of Bicoid and challenges for future studies are reviewed [review]
Cic acts on Bcd dependent enhancer elements by repression and thereby controls the posterior limit of Bcd target gene expression.
Bicoid provides dose-dependent positional information along the axis, maternal Hunchback is required for the synchrony of the response and is therefore likely to be involved in this memorization process.
Results suggest that the ventral splay of segmentation genes along the A-P axis may be directly traced to the distinct properties of the Bcd gradient on the dorsal and ventral sides of the embryo.
The positional precision provided by the Drosophila morphogenetic protein Bicoid (Bcd) in wild-type (wt) embryos with embryos lacking an interacting cofactor, was compared.
Deletion of a short sequence in Bicoid impairs its nuclear accumulation. This effect is due to a approximately 4-fold decrease in nuclear import rate and a approximately 2-fold reduction in nuclear residence time compared with the wild-type protein.
The question of Bcd mobility was investigated using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in live Drosophila melanogaster embryos.
Data show that the addition of dsRNA targeting the fates-shifted (fsd, CG12765) gene caused a consistent increase in the total amount of Bcd.
The formation of the Bicoid morphogen gradient requires protein movement from anteriorly localized mRNA.
Study represents a first experimental uncovering of the actions of Bcd in controlling the actual transcriptional events while its positional information is decoded during development.
Bcd production rate, which is dependent on the total number of bcd mRNA molecules in the anterior, is scaled with embryo volume.
Parameter estimation on models by spatio-temporal Bicoid profiles suggests strong support for regulated stability over either a constant supply rate or one where the maternal mRNA is permitted to degrade in a passive manner.

This study proposes that the establishment of the hunchback pattern relies on Bicoid-dependent lengthening of transcriptional activity periods in the anterior half of the embryo, and may require two distinct repression mechanisms in the posterior.
this study documents, for the first time, a case of within-species Bcd scaling achieved through adjusting the gradient profile's exponential shape characteristic, illustrating at a molecular level how a developmental system can follow distinct operational paths towards the goal of robust and scaled patterning.

Studies indicate that Bicoid (Bcd), is expressed from anteriorly distributed mRNAand forms a decreasing concentration gradient from the anteriorto posterior of the embryo.
The present study examines the effect of advection transport on the formation of the Bicoid morphogen gradient using direct simulation of the cytoplasmic streaming.
These results suggest that synergistic interactions between Dl and Zld and between DI and Bcd are required for broad sog expression.
The Bcd gradient is observed in embryos that express a Bicoid-eGFP fusion protein (Bcd-GFP) which cannot differentiate if Bcd is freely diffusing or bound to immobile sites. This work analyzes an SDID model that includes the Interaction of Bcd with binding sites.
results have important implications for how Bcd recognizes its different targets to mediate its critical developmental functions
The authors find that Bicoid transcriptional activity is dispensable for embryonic viability in the first hour after fertilization, but persistently required throughout the rest of the blastoderm stage. Short interruptions of Bicoid activity alter the most anterior cell fate decisions, while prolonged inactivation expands patterning defects from anterior to posterior.
These data support a model where Bcd influences chromatin structure to gain access to concentration-sensitive targets at high concentrations, while concentration-insensitive targets are found in more accessible chromatin and are bound at low concentrations.
Vinblastine treatment allowed the simulation of an ideal SDD model whereby the protein moved throughout the embryo in a broad front. In unfertilized embryos, the Bcd protein followed the mRNA which itself was transported into the interior of the embryo utilizing a hitherto undiscovered microtubular network

Study shows that subtle differences in the way Dfd and Scr recognize their specific binding sites, in conjunction with non-DNA-binding domains, influence whether the target gene is transcriptionally activated or repressed.
alteration in Scr expression expands or contracts the doublesex domain, and vice versa
Results indicate that Scr functions as a homodimer to increase its transcriptional specificity and suggest that the formation of homeodomain (HD) homo- or heterodimers might underlie the functional distinction between very similar HD proteins in vivo.
Dynamic changes in Sex comb reduced protein expression are responsible for the diversity seen in sex comb morphology.
male-like pattern of SCR expression is independent of dsx function, and dsx F must be responsible for bringing about dimorphism in SCR expression, whereas dsx M function is required with Scr for the morphogenesis of sex comb.
Study shows that the LASCY, DYTQL, NANGE motifs, and the C-terminal domain of SCR mediate suppression of induction of ectopic proboscis identity, which would explain why co-expression of PB and SCR is unable to induce ectopic proboscises.
To test if Hox proteins directly use shape readout, study characterized Exd-Scr co-crystal structures. When minor groove-inserting residues of Scr were mutated to alanines, thus impairing its ability to use shape readout, the mutant proteins no longer preferred sequences containing these minor groove width minima.
Results from NMR spectroscopy show that spontaneous deamidation of Scr protein at residue Asn 321 reduces its affinity for target DNA.
Data show that the Distalless and Engrailed homeodomain transcription factors act through sequences in this enhancer to establish elevated Sex combs reduced (Scr) expression in spatially defined domains.
influences Ftz-F1 activity by interacting with its AF-2 domain in a manner that mimics a nuclear receptor coactivator
FTZ(delta151-209) is a hyperactive FTZ molecule; the region encompassing amino acids 151-209 of FTZ is required in some manner for repression of FTZ activity
Contrasting responses of different downstream targets to Runt in the presence or absence of Ftz is thus central to the combinatorial logic of the pair-rule to segment-polarity transition.
Evolutionary acquisition of the LXXLL motif specialized Ftz for segmentation, while strengthening the Ftz/Ftz-F1 interaction led to degeneration of the YPWM motif and loss of homeotic activity.
Comparative analysis of enhancers containing Ftz/Ftz-F1 binding sites that were or were not bona fide targets in vivo suggested that GAF negatively regulates enhancers that contain Ftz/Ftz-F1 binding sites but are not actually utilized.

The Antennapedia-derived cell-penetating peptide penetratin can translocate through lipid bilayers by a potential- and composition-dependent pathway that causes only minimal perturbation to the overall integrity and barrier function of the bilayer.

The function of Antennapedia in the leg is not to repress homothorax, as has been suggested, but to directly repress spineless and other antennal genes that would otherwise be activated within this ring.
Functional synthetic Antennapedia genes and the YPWM motif play dual roles in transcriptional activation and repression.
High levels of Antp promote the identity of motoneurons that target the distal regions of the femur and tibia.
The Scr promoter interacts with distinct elements in the ftz-Antp interval.
interaction of Antp with TFIIEbeta is important for the functional specificity of Antennapedia, and amino acids 32 and 36 in Antp HD helix 2 are key for this interaction

detect preferential activity of Tailor on 3'-G canonical pre-miRNAs, and specific depletion of such loci from the pool of conserved miRNAs
Tailor is an uridylyltransferase that is required for the majority of 3' end modifications of microRNAs and predominantly targets precursor hairpins
The mutants of Tailor and Dis3L2 are viable and lack overt morphological defects. Instead, these mutants exhibit defects in female and male fertility, implying specific requirements in the germline.
our work reveals useful insights to explain why Drosophila Tailor can preferentially select RNA substrates ending in 3'G and provides important values for further understanding the biological significances of biogenesis pathway of mirtron in flies.
Analysis of crystal structures reveal specific amino acid residues of Tailor that are involved in donor and acceptor substrate recognition, and complementary biochemical assays confirm the critical role of an active site arginine in conferring selectivity toward 3'-guanosine terminated RNAs.

Data indicate that interphase centrioles are closely associated with Sas-4, Spd-2, Polo kinase, Pericentrin-like protein (Dplp), Asterless (Asl), Plk4 kinase, Centrosomin (Cnn) and gamma-tubulin.
Sas-4 acts as a vehicle to tether PCM complexes to centrioles independent of its well-known role in centriole duplication
The authors show here, however, that Cnn, Spd-2 and Asl are not recruited to the mother centriole as part of a complex with Sas-4.
Inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint in the sas-4 mutant impairs neuroblast proliferation and disrupts euploidy.
Cdk1 phosphorylates the conserved centriole protein Sas-4 during mitosis. This creates a Polo-docking site that helps recruit Polo to daughter centrioles.
By halfway through pupal life, the centriole number decreases and structural defects, ranging from being incomplete or lacking B-tubules, are detected. Asl, Ana1 and Sas-4 are still present, suggesting that the centriole integrity does not depend on these proteins.
These observations identify Plk1/Polo kinase regulation of Sas-4 as essential for efficient pericentriolar material expansion.
Here, the authors show that PLK4 phosphorylates its centriole substrate STIL on a conserved site, S428, to promote STIL binding to CPAP. This phospho-dependent binding interaction is conserved in Drosophila and facilitates the stable incorporation of both STIL and CPAP into the centriole.

DNlg3 is required for neuromuscular junction development, synaptic differentiation, and function
TACE cleaved DNlg3 exclusively at its extracellular acetylcholinesterase-like domain to generate the N-terminal fragment and the short membrane-anchored fragment (sDNlg3). DNlg3 was constitutively processed in an activity-independent manner. It was cleaved intracellularly in the Golgi apparatus before it arrived at the cell surface.
Overexpression of dnlg1 in muscle resulted in synaptic overgrowth, but reduced the amplitudes of excitatory junctional currents.

Genetic interaction experiments demonstrate Syx4, Syt4, and Nlg1 regulate synaptic growth and plasticity through both shared and parallel signaling pathways.
dnlg1 mutants have reduced levels of Wit.  Dnlg1 is required for proper localization and stability of Wit.
The authors find that axonal branch growth is regulated by dynamic, focal localisations of Neurexin and Neuroligin. These adhesion complexes provide stability for filopodia by a 'stick-and-grow' based mechanism wholly independent of synaptic activity.
The disruption of DNlg1, DNlg2, or their presynaptic partner neurexin (DNrx) led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of F-actin. Further study showed that DNlg1, but not DNlg2 or DNlg3, directly interacts with the WRC via its C-terminal interacting receptor sequence.

Evidence suggests that Prat originated by gene duplication by retrotransposition of Prat2.
Regulation of expression of prat in the adult eye was studied.
limiting factor in the processes of cellular or nuclear proliferation that take place during egg chamber and embryonic development
Use of Prat and Prat2 double RNA interference causes more severe pupal lethal phenotypes and suggests that Prat and Prat2 have partially additive functions during Drosophila metamorphosis.
Data show that the requirement for both Prat and Prat2 in Drosophila is not simply due to differences in protein function. Both genes have developed nonoverlapping patterns of expression, which correlate with their respective loss-of-function phenotypes.
whereas Mod(Prat:bw)3-5 suppresses Prat in all stages and tissues examined for both sexes.

opposing gradients of two Drosophila transcriptional repressors, Hunchback (Hb) and Knirps (Kni), position several segments by differentially repressing two distinct regulatory regions (enhancers) of the pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve)
Results suggest that the differential regulation of Hunchback is achieved by a mechanism that integrates information created by the asymmetric distribution of Seven-up and Prospero.

quantified the dynamics of hb gene expression in flies that were wild-type, were mutant for hb self-regulation or Bcd binding, or contained an artificial promoter construct consisting of six Bcd and two Hb sites
Data propose that Hunchback maintains early neuroblast competence by silencing a suite of late-expressed genes.
Bicoid provides dose-dependent positional information along the axis, maternal Hunchback is required for the synchrony of the response and is therefore likely to be involved in this memorization process.
WT (self-regulatory) Hb output noise is predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations.

The stripe enhancer is crucial for establishing the definitive border of the anterior Hb expression pattern during embryogenesis.
This study proposes that the establishment of the hunchback pattern relies on Bicoid-dependent lengthening of transcriptional activity periods in the anterior half of the embryo, and may require two distinct repression mechanisms in the posterior.
The expression of Hunchback in the neuroblast increases over time and the absolute levels of its expression specify two different Crustacean-cardioactive-peptide neuronal fates.

Study concludes that hunchback (Hb) functions in progenitors (neuroblasts/GMCs) to establish heritable neuronal identity that is maintained by a Hb-independent mechanism.
Hunchback (Hb) regulates a significant number of genes that are expressed during late differentiation stages. Hb is expressed in two polyploid subperineurial glia cells (carpet cells) and a thorough functional analysis shows that loss of Hb function results in a loss of carpet cells in the eye-antennal disc.
While Hunchback directly represses the eve stripe 3+7 enhancer, study found that in the eve stripe 2+7 enhancer, Hunchback repression is prevented by nearby sequences-this phenomenon is called counter-repression.

MICALs, a family of conserved flavoprotein oxidoreductases, function in plexin-mediated axonal repulsion.
Transgenic expression of interfering RNA molecules demonstrates that MICAL is required in muscles for the higher order arrangement of myofilaments.
a previously unknown pathway composed of Sox14 and its cytoskeletal target Mical governs dendrite severing during development
Mical is both necessary and sufficient for semaphorin-plexin-mediated F-actin reorganization in vivo
actin filament subunits were directly modified by Mical on their conserved pointed-end, critical for filament assembly; Mical posttranslationally oxidized the methionine 44 residue within D-loop of actin, severing filaments and decreasing polymerization
Mical oxidizes actin stereospecifically to generate actin Met-44-R-sulfoxide.
Mical and cofilin, therefore, form a redox-dependent synergistic pair that promotes F-actin instability by rapidly dismantling F-actin and generating post-translationally modified actin that has altered assembly properties

Jumeau (Jumu), a member of the forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family, controls hemocyte differentiation of lymph gland through multiple regulatory mechanisms.
Jumu is required for circulating hemocyte differentiation and phagocytosis in Drosophila
Loss of Jumeau (Jumu) function triggers apoptosis via a JNK-dependent pathway in wing development. jumu mutants show reduced wing size, a loss of the anterior cross vein (ACV) phenotype, and increased apoptosis. The JNK signaling markers puckered (puc) and p-JNK are increased in the wing discs of jumu mutants. Apoptosis induced by the loss of jumu is rescued by knocking down JNK.
Study reports that Drosophila protein Jumu binds N6-methyladenine (6mA)-marked DNA and acts as a maternal factor to regulate the maternal-to-zygotic transition and finds that zelda encoding the pioneer factor Zelda is marked by 6mA. Genetic assays suggest that Jumu controls the proper zygotic genome activation in early embryos, at least in part, by regulating zelda expression.

homothorax is both necessary and sufficient for inner Photoreceptors to adopt the polarization-sensitive DRA fate instead of the color-sensitive default state
Labial, Ultrabithorax, Antennapedia, Extradenticle and Homothorax are regulated in a signal transduction pathway in developing Drosophila brain
Wingless andDecapentaplegic act independently as the primary signals for the repression of teashirt and hth, respectively

Implication of Hth in the regulation of cell growth and endoreplication in larval salivary glands.
Homothorax transcription factor is maternally provided and that its function is necessary for the proper assembly of the centric/centromeric heterochromatin during preblastodermic divisions.
Hth and Yki are bound to a DNA sequence approximately 14 kb upstream of the bantam hairpin in eye imaginal disc cells
experiments reveal three additional functions for hth: the cell cycle of progenitors is characterized by a relatively long G2 phase, which makes them prone to enter mitosis; hth represses the burst of string/cdc25 expression that precedes G1 arrest
This work suggests that the transcriptional activity of all members of the Meis/Prep Hth protein family is subject to autoinhibition by their Hth domains, and that the Meis3.2 splice variant encodes a protein that bypasses this autoinhibitory effect.

The retinal determination gene Dachshund restricts cell proliferation by limiting the activity of the Homothorax-Yorkie complex
the satellite repeats get transcribed in wild type embryos and that this transcription depends on the presence of Hth, which binds to them as well as to the ribosomal DNA region.
Hth+Tsh-induced tissue overgrowth requires the BMP2 Dpp and the abnormal hyperactivation of its pathway. Rather than using autocrine Dpp expression, Hth+Tsh cells increase their avidity for Dpp, produced locally, by upregulating extracellular matrix components.
Rather than directly regulating cell cycle genes, hth and tsh control cell proliferation through an intermediary layer of nuclear receptors of the ecdysone/estrogen-signaling pathway.
The Ubx cofactor, Homothorax (Hth), was co-enriched with Ubx near enhancers that require Hth, even though Ubx and Hth did not co-localize throughout the nucleus. Thus, microenvironments of high local transcription factor and cofactor concentrations could help low-affinity sites overcome their kinetic inefficiency.

results indicate that dSETDB1 and SU(VAR)3-9 act together with distinct roles during oogenesis, with dsetdb1 being of particular importance due to its germline stem cell-specific function and more severe mutant phenotype
The genetic interactions between dSETDB1 and Su(var)3-9 mutations emphasize the importance of maintaining the activities of these histone methyltransferases in balance for normal genome function.

we discuss the emerging role of CP190 in tethering genome, specifically in the perspective of insulator function in Drosophila.
As binding of CP190 does not enhance luciferase activity in reporter assays.

A translin null mutant was generated and a trax nonsense mutation was isolated. Translin is essential for stabilizing its interaction with trax.
an RNAi regulator that we term C3PO (component 3 promoter of RISC), a complex of Translin and Trax was purified; C3PO is a Mg2+-dependent endoribonuclease that promotes RISC activation by removing siRNA passenger strand cleavage products
These studies establish that Trax adopts the translin fold, possesses catalytic centers essential for C3PO's endoRNase activity and interacts extensively with translin to form an octameric assembly.
Findings indicate that the loss of Translin/TRAX complex (dmC3PO) promoted the accumulation of the passenger strand of esi-2.1 (hp-CG4068B) and increased the accumulation of miR-bantam.

during metamorphosis, all Rh6 photoreceptors die, whereas the Rh5 photoreceptors switch fate by turning off Rh5 and then turning on Rh6 expression
Light reception mediated by Rh5 and Rh6 must utilize either a different (nonretinal) phospholipase C-beta enzyme or alternative signaling mechanisms, at least in terms of clock-relevant photoreception
Rh5 and Rh6 were required in trpA1-expressing neurons in the brain, ventral nerve cord, and body wall. Because Rh1 contributes to thermal selection in the comfortable range during the early to mid-third-instar stage, fine thermal discrimination depends on multiple rhodopsins.
Study results show that both Ort and HisCl1 define two different pathways for circadian entrainment. Whereas Ort contributes through its expression in the interneurons of the optic lobe, HisCl1 mostly contributes through its expression in the Rh6-expressing retinal photoreceptors. The work thus reveals that Rh6-expressing neurons contribute to light-mediated entrainment as both photoreceptors and interneurons.

Embryos with double-stranded RNA corresponding to dGATAe failed to express marker genes that are characteristic of differentiated midgut.
GATAe activates a major subset of genes in the midgut, and some other pathway(s) downstream of srp activates other genes.
GATAe has pivotal roles in maintaining normal epithelial homeostasis of the Drosophila adult midgut through interaction of N signaling
We further demonstrate that JAK/STAT signaling, Sox21a and GATAe form a functional relay to orchestrate EB differentiation. Thus, our study provides new insights into the complex and sequential events that are required for rapid differentiation following stem cell division during tissue replenishment.
dGATAe and grn expression are independent of each other; dGATAe and grn are not responsible for setting the general embryonic midgut morphology; results clarify the expression patterns and function of the GATA factor genes expressed in the embryonic midgut

Here the authors show in vitro and in Drosophila that Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) inactivates Mps1 by dephosphorylating its T-loop. PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of Mps1 occurs at kinetochores and in the cytosol, and inactivation of both pools of Mps1 during metaphase is essential to ensure prompt and efficient Spindle Assembly Checkpoint silencing.

At the same time it is also clear that neither the TAR2 mutation nor RNAi wholly eliminates the TA response.

photoreceptor cell identity in Drosophila is critically regulated by the transcription factor Glass
Glass has a dual role in establishing a functional Drosophila eye. Glass links photoreceptor specification/patterning and terminal differentiation. Glass mutant photoreceptors are capable of surviving pupal development but fail to differentiate. The role of Glass in ommatidium patterning and photoreceptor differentiation are separable. Pph13 is its direct transcriptional target. * Pph13 is a direct transcriptional target
Authors conclude that Glass can either directly or indirectly initiate the expression of most phototransduction proteins in a Hazy-independent manner, and that Hazy is mainly required for the maintenance of functional photoreceptors in adult flies.
Glass is a determinant of organ identity that acts in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells to promote their differentiation into functional components of the eye.
Results suggest that the expression of glass is tightly regulated as the development of a functional tissue surprisingly does not result in detectable change in the physiological response or alteration in photo-attraction behavior upon deletion of the smORF. Similarly, only one of the isoforms is critical for eye development.

modifiers of the rough eye phenotype resulting from overexpression of the Notch antagonist hairless in Drosophila
Hairless acts as an adaptor to recruit the corepressors Groucho and dCtBP to Suppressor of Hairless. H directly binds two corepressor proteins, Groucho (Gro) and dCtBP.
Two isoforms of the Notch antagonist Hairless are produced by differential translation initiation. The presence of either isoform throughout the cell cycle allows efficient inhibition of Notch-regulated cell proliferation.
Hairless has a second mode of repression that antagonizes Notch intracellular domain and is independent of Gro or CtBP binding.
Data show that Pros26.4 negatively regulates Hairless at the genetic and molecular level, providing a novel mechanism of positive regulation of Notch signalling.
Hairless is a central component of the regulation of the Notch signalling pathway in Drosophila, and is hence essential for cell differentiation and tissue development in the fly.
The results indicate that H induces apoptosis by downregulation of EGFR signalling activity.
Hairless (H) is a Runt-interacting molecule that functions during segmentation. H is important for maintenance of engrailed (en) repression.
we identify a site in Hairless that is crucial for binding Su(H) protein
Data show that the differential recruitment of the co-repressors Gro and CtBP by H in a context-dependent manner ensures fine tuning of Notch signaling activity during eye development.
Genes activated by Notch signaling at the dorsal-ventral boundary of wing disc fall into classes affected differently by the loss of kinase module subunits. The distinctions do not result from different requirements for Hairless.
Data mapped the residues in Suppressor of Hairless Su(H) that contact Hairless, and mutation of these sites neither affects binding to DNA nor to Notch.
There are two potential MAPK phosphorylation sites within the H protein; mutation of the two sites had only minor effects on the biological activity of H, suggesting that they are not major targets of MAPK

aberrant function of LRRK2 may lead to destabilization of neural circuits.
EndophilinA-induced macroautophagy is activated when the kinase LRRK2 phosphorylates the EndophilinA-BAR domain and is blocked in animals where EndophilinA cannot be phosphorylated. Functionally, deregulation of the EndophilinA phosphorylation state accelerates activity-induced neurodegeneration.
Data support the view that LRRK2/Lrrk is a gene/protein involved in oxidative stress-signaling leading to neurodegenerative process and loss of DAergic neurons and that reduced/suppressed LRRK2 expression might delay or prevent motor symptoms and/or frank Parkinsonism in individuals at risk to suffer autosomal dominant Parkinsonism.

The ionotropic receptors IR40a, IR93a, and IR25a are all required for humidity preference in D. melanogaster. Whereas IR40a is selectively required for hygrosensory responses, IR93a and IR25a mediate both humidity and temperature preference. Consistent with this, the expression of IR93a and IR25a includes thermosensory neurons of the arista.
These results identify IR93a as a common component of molecularly and cellularly distinct ionotropic receptor pathways important for thermosensation and hygrosensation in insects.
Here, the authors discover Drosophila moist cells and show that they require IR25a and IR93a together with IR68a, a conserved, but orphan ionotropic receptor for hygrosensation.

Altered Atg6 function in flies causes hematopoietic abnormalities and lethality, and this is due to defects in multiple membrane trafficking processes.
The UVRAG-containing PI3K (III) complex is required for receptor downregulation through endolysosomal degradation and for the establishment of proper cell polarity in the developing wing.
lowered expression of Atg6 or Pi3K59F in Ddc-Gal4-expressing neurons results in decreased longevity and associated age-dependent loss of locomotor ability. Inhibition of Atg6 or Pi3K59F together with overexpression of the sole pro-survival Bcl-2 Drosophila homolog Buffy in Ddc-Gal4-expressing neurons resulted in further decrease in the survival
Atg6 is required for the inhibitory effect of metformin on intestinal stem cell aging.
Two cohesin subunits (SMC1 and SA) are essential for axon pruning.
Meiotic nondisjunction was increased in aged Drosophila oocytes when the cohesin protein SMC1 is reduced.

SOLO and SMC1 are both enriched on centromeres throughout prophase I, co-align along the lateral elements of SCs and reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate from ovarian protein extracts.
These data indicate that the initial meiotic pairing of homologs is not sufficient to yield synapsis exclusively between homologs and provide a model in which meiotic homolog pairing must be stabilized by centromeric SMC1 to ensure proper synapsis
analysis of epistatic interactions related to mutation of Syx1A
Syntaxin 1A molecules share a conserved threonine in C-terminal +7 layer near transmembrane domain. Mutation of threonine to isoleucine results in a structural change that resembles those found in syntaxins ascribed to the constitutive secretory pathway
The Syx1A dependent trafficking of Grk protein is required for efficient EGFR signaling during dorsal-ventral patterning.
Syntaxin1A domain formation is induced by phosphoinositide-3,4,5-triphosphate; this clustering is dependent on positively charged residues in the juxtamembrane domain.

hyperactivation of TORC1 following the loss of TSC1/2 is detrimental to stem cell maintenance and multiple lineage differentiation in the Drosophila intestinal stem cell lineage, a mechanism that could be conserved in other stem cell lineages
Data indicate that TORC1 activation by PVR involves Tsc1/Tsc2.
TSC1 is growth and size regulator, inhibit TOR-mediated amino acid availability to S6 kinase and translation initiation, its muscle and fat overactivation significantly extends lifespan.

Drosophila Apc1 and Apc2 regulate Wingless transduction throughout development.
APC1 and APC2 play functionally redundant roles in brain development
Drosophila APC2 and APC1 play overlapping roles in wingless signaling in the embryo and imaginal discs.
results show that dividing male germline stem cells use mechanisms involving centrosome function and cortically localized APC to orient mitotic spindles ensuring an asymmetric outcome in which one cell self renews and the other initiates differentiation
Results show that although complete loss of APC1 and APC2 resulted in activation of Wingless signaling, it did not alter cell viability, cadherin-based adhesion, spindle morphology, orientation or selection of division plane, as predicted.
findings demonstrate that Drosophila Apc homologs have an activating role in both physiological and ectopic Wingless signaling; Apc likely promotes Wingless transduction through down-regulation of Axin, a negative regulator of Wingless signaling
Apc activity is not present in vast excess, but instead is near the minimal level required for accurate graded responses to the Wingless morphogen.
APC2 and DIA function in a novel complex that affects actin directly, rather than through an effect on microtubules
Data show that although cortical localization is required for the APC2 function in organizing actin, cortical localization is dispensable for its role in regulating Wnt signaling.
These data suggest that APC2 does not have to shuttle into the nucleus or localize to a particular subcellular location to regulate Wnt signaling.
Data show that a loss of function for dapc1 or both dapc1 and dapc2 (dapc) in ovary border (BC) and adjacent follicle cells impaired BC delamination, and this mutant phenotype can be rescued upon overexpression of either dapc1 or dapc2.

Miranda protein forms an apical crescent at interphase, but is ubiquitously localized at prophase in a Myosin-II-dependent manner.
Genetic characterization of the Drosophila jaguar322 mutant reveals that complete myosin VI loss of function is not lethal.
Results suggest that myosin VI does not need to dimerize via the predicted coiled coil to stabilize actin in vivo.
data indicate that myosin V and VI, but not II, play related but distinct roles in regulating microtubule (MT)-based mitochondrial movement: they oppose, rather than complement, protracted MT-based movements and perhaps facilitate organelle docking
These data demonstrate that generating an organized and functional actin structure in this cell requires multiple activities coordinated by myosin VI.
The androcam structure and its binding to the myosin VI structural (Insert 2) and regulatory (IQ) light chain sites are distinct from those of calmodulin.
These observations support the notion that a major function of Myosin VI in the nerve terminal is tethering synaptic vesicles to proper sub-cellular location within the bouton

ana1 mutants lack detectable centrosomes in vivo, that Ana1 is irreversibly incorporated into centrioles during their assembly and appears to play a more important role in maintaining Asl at centrioles than in initially recruiting Asl to centrioles...the N-terminal region of Ana1 (amino acids 1-935) is required to target Ana1 to centrioles through a direct interaction with Cep135, whereas the C-terminal region of Ana1.
By halfway through pupal life, the centriole number decreases and structural defects, ranging from being incomplete or lacking B-tubules, are detected. Asl, Ana1 and Sas-4 are still present, suggesting that the centriole integrity does not depend on these proteins.

Loss of spastic paraplegia gene atlastin induces age-dependent death of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila
results suggest that Atlastin controls synapse development and ER and Golgi morphogenesis by regulating microtubule stability
results demonstrate that Atlastin mediates membrane tethering and fusion and strongly suggest that it is the GTPase activity that is required for endoplasmic reticulum homotypic fusion
atlastin dimerizes in the presence of GTPgammaS but is monomeric with GDP or without nucleotide. Oligomerization requires the juxtamembrane middle domain three-helix bundle, as does efficient GTPase activity.
increasing the distance of atlastin complex formation from the membrane inhibits fusion, suggesting that this distance is crucial for atlastin to promote fusion
The homotypic fusion of endoplasmic reticulum membranes is mediated by atlastin through lipid interaction with the C terminus and association of the transmembrane segments.
VCP was validated as an atlastin-interacting protein.
Data indicate that expression of either the K320E or E328R atlastin GTPase (D-ATL) variant led to dominant-negative perturbations of the endoplasmic reticulum.
purified and reconstituted human ATL1 exhibited no in vitro fusion activity. When the cytosolic segment of human ATL1 was connected to the transmembrane (TM) region and C-terminal tail (CT) of Drosophila ATL
These data suggest that the C-terminal tail of Atlastin locally destabilizes bilayers to facilitate membrane fusion.
Data indicate that GTP hydrolysis is required for atlastin (ATL)-mediated vesicle tethering.

Involved with Slob protein in the circadian regulation of rhythmic locomotor behavior
monomeric D14-3-3zeta is capable of modulating dSlo channel activity in this regulatory complex.
the amino-terminal region of Slob plays a critical role in its modulation of dSlo
the slowpoke channel must be involved in triggering or producing a homeostatic mechanism that opposes the sedative effects of ethanol.
The Drosophila slowpoke gene includes 14 alternative exons distributed among five sites of alternative splicing. Slowpoke transcripts undergo tissue- and developmental-specific splicing in Drosophila and some exons are diagnostic for specific tissues.
These results implicate distinct calcium-dependent and -independent mechanisms in the modulation of dSlo by Slob
synaptic strength and synaptic strength at neuromuscular junctions along the dorsal-ventral differentials at physiological Ca(2+) levels were not significantly altered in slowpoke (slo) and Shaker (Sh) mutants

Slo mutant larvae exhibit alterations in synapse morphology, active zone size and neurotransmission that are similar to dysc mutants.
slowpoke channels are required specifically in motoneurones for maximum firing rates during locomotion.
SLO2 Channels Are Inhibited by All Divalent Cations That Activate SLO1 K+ Channels
Removal of element 6b from the endogenous slo gene affected the production of functional ethanol tolerance in an ethanol-vapor recovery from sedation assay.
we discovered that activation of PKG in BK channel loss-of-function (Slo(4)) mutants significantly decreases time to stimulus-induced synaptic failure, providing the first evidence of PKG and BK channels functioning independently to control synaptic transmission tolerance to acute oxidative stress.

BMP4 inhibits Tolloid enzyme activity noncompetitively
These studies highlight how the bipartite function of Tolloid CUB domains, in substrate and extracellular matrix interactions, fine-tune protease activity to a particular developmental context.
asp mutation leads to severe defects in spindle microtubule organization within the germarium. The mitotic spindles of the mutant cystocytes are composed by wavy microtubules and have abnormal poles that often lack gamma-tubulin.
dynein, abnormal spindle protein (Asp), and KLP10A have roles in Drosophila spindle pole organization
propose that Asp regulates neuroepithelium morphogenesis through myosin-II-mediated structural and mechanical processes to maintain force balance and tissue cohesiveness
Asp-CaM complex has a critical role in centrosome-pole cohesion and centrosome inheritance in neural stem cells
Asp at the minus ends of the microtubules cross-links MTs at the pole and within the spindle
in this study we have provided evidence that ASPM controls spindle orientation by regulating the dynamics of astral MT and that CITK is a critical downstream partner of ASPM for this activity.
Dynein, Mud and Asp operate sequentially during the cell cycle to ensure efficient centrosome-spindle coupling in mitosis, thereby preventing centrosome mis-segregation to maintain centrosome number.
Midgut-preferential RNA knockdown of the peptide hormones AstA or Dh31 respectively results in decreased or increased adult lifespan. This effect on longevity is apparently correlated with the midgut senescence phenotypes as a result of direct hormone action through both hormone receptors expressed in the enteroblasts or other midgut cell types
Va-A1 neurons terminally differentiate into DH31/AstA-expressing neurons (neuropeptidergic fate I) by virtue of Ubx activity, and Va-A2-A4 neurons terminally differentiate into Capa-expressing neurons
These data suggest that AstA/AstAR1 acts to coordinate juvenile growth with maturation. Interesting, AstA/AstAR1 is homologous to KISS/GPR54, a ligand-receptor signal required for human puberty, suggesting that an evolutionary conserved neural circuitry controls the onset of maturation.

Co-expression of Drosophila Pen-2 with Aph-1 and nicastrin increases the formation of Psn fragments as well as gamma-secretase activity
Aph-1 and Nct may form a subcomplex that stabilizes the Psn holoprotein at an early step in gamma-secretase assembly.
the proper assembly of the Aph-1.nicastrin subcomplex with presenilin is the prerequisite for the trafficking as well as the enzymatic activity of the gamma-secretase complex and Aph-1 functions as a stabilizing scaffold in the assembly of this complex
presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, are present and enriched on phagosome membranes from both murine macrophages and Drosophila S2 phagocytes
Nicastrin is essential to early photoreceptor neuron development
Down-regulation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter 2 (Abca2) reduces amyloid-beta production by altering Nicastrin maturation and intracellular localization.
Nct is required for neuronal survival during aging and normal lifespan.

electrostatic effect of protein phosphorylation can be partially mimicked by a mutant form of SLBP wherein four C-terminal serines are replaced with glutamic acids
Removal of the phosphoryl group from T230 by either dephosphorylation or mutation results in a 7-fold reduction in the affinity of SLBP for the stem-loop RNA
Slbp mutants display genomic instability, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), increased presence of chromosome breaks, tetraploidy, and changes in position effect variegation (PEV).
The nuclear magnetic resonance and kinetic studies presented here provide a framework for understanding how SLBP recognizes histone mRNA and highlight possible structural roles of phosphorylation and proline isomerization in RNA binding proteins
nuclear retention involves Chk2-mediated inactivation of the Drosophila stem loop binding protein (SLBP), the levels of which are specifically depleted in damaged nuclei following Chk2 phosphorylation, an event that contributes to nuclear fallout.
Although the C-terminal tail of dSLBP does not contact the RNA, phosphorylation of the tail promotes SLBP conformations competent for RNA binding and thereby appears to reduce the entropic penalty for the association.

Pointed, an activator, and Tramtrack69, a repressor, directly regulate the transcription of string and thereby cell proliferation
Induction of stg rescues the neuroblast proliferation defect in trol mutant animals.
string(cdc25) and cyclin E control patterned histone expression at different stages of Drosophila embryonic development.
EYA and SO may influence cell proliferation through transcriptional regulation of stg.
String and dappled were identified as being important for the proper formation of adult external sensory (ES) organs.
double-stranded RNA-mediated depletion of dPrp38 or dMFAP1 causes cells to arrest in G(2)/M, and this is paralleled by a reduction in mRNA levels of the mitotic phosphatase string/cdc25.
Thereby, we show that abdominal histoblasts, which grow while in G2 arrest during larval stages, enter a proliferative stage in the pupal period that is initiated by ecdysone-dependent string/Cdc25 phosphatase transcription.
SIN3 and STG are linked in a genetic pathway that affects cell cycle progression in a developing tissue
String (Cdc25) regulates stem cell maintenance, proliferation and aging in Drosophila testis.
findings suggest that high Cdc25 and Cdk1 contribute to the speed of the rapid, pre-midblastula transition (MBT) S phases and that down-regulation of these activities plays a broader role in MBT-associated changes than was previously suspected
Premature removal of cdc25 transcripts by RNAi did not affect progression to the midblastula transition.
The degradation rate of String protein gradually increases during the late syncytial cycles in a manner dependent on the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and on the DNA replication checkpoints.
we show that during the development of epithelial cells in the imaginal discs, the G2/M transition, and hence cell proliferation, is controlled by Emc via Da. In eukaryotic cells, the main activator of this transition is the Cdc25 phosphatase, string
During embryonic development of the mushroom body, Ptp99A is expressed within an expanded core region including somewhat older axons.
Diedel, a marker of the Drosophila antimicrobial/antiviral response, is a member of a small family of proteins present in drosophilids, aphids and DNA viruses infecting lepidopterans

The caspase effector DRICE is activated during apoptosis in both mid- and late oogenesis; however, active DRICE was found more ubiquitously and at a higher level during germline cell death in midoogenesis.
examination of inhibition by DIAP1
Ecdysone-mediated up-regulation of the effector caspase DRICE is required for hormone-dependent apoptosis in Drosophila cells.
A double-mutant analysis between drICE and death caspase-1 (dcp-1), another effector caspase, reveals that some cells (type I) strictly require drICE for apoptosis, whereas other cells (type II) require either drICE or dcp-1.
The Drosophila caspase Ice is important for many apoptotic cell deaths and for spermatid individualization, a nonapoptotic process
Ice is essential for induction of apoptosis in S2 cells.
Because DIAP2 efficiently interacts with drICE, our data suggest that DIAP2 controls drICE in its apoptotic and nonapoptotic roles.
The conjugation of ubiquitin to ice suppresses its catalytic potential in cleaving caspase substrates.
sterol regulatory element-binding protein is activated by the caspase Drice in Drosophila larvae
Arm is a major regulator of cadherin-mediated adhesion and is cleaved by caspases in embryo extracts and study provides evidence that the caspase-3 homolog drICE cleaves Arm in vitro and in vivo.
Data suggest that the cleaved-Caspase-3 antibody recognizes multiple proteins including DCP-1 and likely DRICE, but also at least one additional unknown protein, all of which require DRONC for epitope exposure.
Drosophila corazonin-producing interneuron programmed cell death utilizes dronc, strica, dcp-1, and ice
The cleaved DIAP1 binds drICE, inhibits its protease activity, and also targets drICE for ubiquitylation.
Both autophagy and caspase activity are induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone during the larval-prepupal transition.
drICE plays an important role in activating corpse clearance in dying cells, and that an additional function of effector caspases is required for the activation of corpse clearance as well as that for carrying out cell death.
Genetic characterization of two gain-of-function alleles of the effector caspase DrICE in Drosophila.
Stable neck-core interactions in ncd generate a binding geometry between motor & microtubule, placing motor ahead of cargo in the minus-end direction. After ATP uptake, the heads rearrange, promoting a swing of the neck in the minus-end direction.
results show that the nucleotide-binding site of kinesin-family motors closes when the motor.diphosphate complex binds to microtubules
KLP61F prevents Ncd-mediated collapse of a nonmicrotubule matrix derived from the interphase nucleus
Spindle assembly occurs in an ncd mutant, but interactions between microtubule-coated chromosomes are unstable; thus Ncd movement along microtubules is needed to stabilize interactions between chromosomes.
a bidirectional Drosophila Kinesin-14 motor that moves either to the microtubule plus or minus end in vitro unexpectedly causes only minor spindle defects in vivo
results show that the force-producing conformational change in Ncd occurs on ATP binding, as in other kinesins, but involves the swing of a lever-arm mechanical element similar to that described for myosins
These data demonstrate generation of sliding forces between adjacent microtubules by Ncd, and they confirm the proposed roles of kinesins-14 in the mitotic spindle morphogenesis.
Motility of a truncation series of Ncd and removal of the tubulin tail suggested that the Ncd tail serves as an electrostatic tether to microtubules.
The tail of ncd is essential for binding to spindles and centrosomes, but both the head and tail are needed for normal spindle assembly and function.
Results show that kinesin-14 causes sliding and expansion of anti-parallel microtubules by interactions through the motor domain on one side and the tail domain on the other, and that this accounts for the roles of kinesin-14 in spindle organization.
mutation of a single residue in the kinesin-14 Ncd causes the motor to release ADP and hydrolyze ATP faster than wild type
Ensemble averaging for each event category revealed that plus- and minus-directed strokes have different size and occur at different instants within the ncd-microtubules attachment sequence.
Data suggest that the C-terminal residues of Ncd play an important role in modulating the interaction of the motor with the microtubule.
Mutation of an invariant residue in loop L7 of the central beta-sheet of the Drosophila kinesin-14 Ncd motor alters both nucleotide and microtubule binding, although the mutated residue is not present in either site.
Drosophila Ncd reveals an evolutionarily conserved powerstroke mechanism for homodimeric and heterodimeric kinesin-14s.
tip-tracking of kinesin-14 occurs through several concurrent mechanisms: binding of kinesin only to EB1 located at the MT end, interaction of the kinesin molecules with a composite site formed by EB1 and the MT tip, and probably surface diffusion of the tail along MT.
14-3-3 translates a spatial cue provided by Aurora B to target Ncd selectively to the spindle within the large volume of oocytes.
In vitro experiments using the drosophila kinesin-14, non-claret disjunctional (Ncd) show that the diffusive anchorage indeed impacts the force that kinesin-14 motors can generate between two microtubules and that modifications of the anchorage interfaces may act as a regulatory factor influencing the force generation by kinesin-14.
the stable compact conformation of Ncd may represent an initial state of the working stroke.
Kinesin-14 motors drive a right-handed helical motion of antiparallel microtubules around each other.
Here, we describe a mutation in the full-of-bacteria (fob) gene, which encodes Drosophila Vps16B

Developmental appearance of the peptidergic, Capability-expressing Va neurons
regulation of cellular ion and water homeostasis mediated by capa peptide signaling in the insect Malpighian (renal) tubules is a key physiological mechanism during recovery from desiccation and cold stress.
Va-A1 neurons terminally differentiate into DH31/AstA-expressing neurons (neuropeptidergic fate I) by virtue of Ubx activity, and Va-A2-A4 neurons terminally differentiate into Capa-expressing neurons
This study provides evidence that low (femtomolar) and high (micromolar) doses of CAPA impair and improve chill tolerance, respectively, via two different effects on Malpighian tubule ion and water transport. While low doses of CAPA are anti-diuretic, reduce tubule K(+) clearance rates and reduce chill tolerance, high doses facilitate K(+) clearance from the haemolymph and increase chill tolerance.
members of the TRP family are "special assignment" channels, which are recruited to diverse signaling pathways.
Single amino acid change in the fifth transmembrane segment of the TRP Ca2+ channel causes massive degeneration of photoreceptors.
Paper briefly overviews current knowledge of TRP and its mammalian homologues as non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that are constitutively active or gated by a multitude of stimuli; thus TRPs may play divergent roles in cell pathophysiology.
Data show that a substantial reduction of the TRP channel protein by RNA interference completely rescues neuronal degeneration and significantly improves the light-elicited responses of the eye.
TRP has independent channel and scaffolding roles
INAF-B gene product is an integral membrane protein that colocalizes to rhabdomeres along with TRP channels.

These results indicate that the Pain TRP channels in the MBs and IPCs control neuronal plasticity that is required for the formation of a certain type of long-lasting associative memory in Drosophila.
TRP and TRPL assemble exclusively as homomultimeric channels in their native environment.
Data show that phosphorylation of most ransient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel sites depends on the phototransduction cascade and the activity of the TRP.
TRP de-phosphorylation affects the detection limit of oscillating light in photoreceptor cells.
results indicate that properties of the light-activated channels together with the dynamic light-dependent process of TRP phosphorylation at the S936 site determine response kinetics

Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs)Dilp2 and Dilp3, but not Dilp5, transcripts were significantly affected by DTKR knockdown in insulin-producing cells both in fed and starved flies.
DSas-6 and Ana2 normally cooperate to drive the formation of the centriole inner cartwheel and they promote both centriole duplication and centriole cohesion in a Sak/Plk4-dependent manner.
Thus, efficient centriole duplication in flies requires the homo-oligomerisation of both Sas-6 and Ana2.
These results indicate that centriole biogenesis does not strictly depend on SAS-6 self-assembly, and may require preexisting centrioles to ensure structural accuracy, fundamentally deviating from the current paradigm.
Data dhow that spindle assembly abnormal 6 protein (SAS-6) is recruited to the centriole through an undescribed pathway mediated by pericentrin.

Axin synergizes with Notch to regulate the activity of armadillo in Drosophila.

membrane-tethered Axin is sufficient for the proper transduction of Wg signal in the patterning of the Drosophila embryo
differential requirements of contact residues in Axin for interactions with GSK3beta or beta-catenin.
This result implies that Dishevelled has the potential to act as a "natural" dominant-negative, binding to the polymerization interface of Axin's DIX domain to interfere with its self-assembly
Data show that Axin and Apc, but not GSK3, modulate the ligand-independent traffic of Notch.
co-expression experiments reveal that APC displaces Dishevelled from Axin assemblies, promoting degradasome over signalosome formation in the absence of Wnts
Daxin physically interacts with DTNKS, and its protein levels are elevated in the absence of DTNKS in the eye discs.
The pool of ADP-ribosylated Axin, which is degraded under basal conditions, increases immediately following Wnt stimulation in both Drosophila and human cells.
We conclude that even in the unstimulated state, a pool of Axin forms membrane-proximal puncta that are dependent on Apc, and that membrane association regulates both Axin levels and Axin's role in the rapid activation of signaling that follows Wnt exposure.
Novel requirement for APC in Axin regulation through phosphorylation both prevents signaling in the Wnt-off state and promotes signaling immediately following Wnt stimulation.

A conserved N-terminal motif in Rad54 is important for chromatin remodeling and homologous strand pairing.  Its autoinhibitory activity is relieved by Rad51.
Ectopically expressed DmRad51 disrupts cell cycle regulation and induces apoptosis.
Data show that when both spnA and lig4 were mutated and a circular donor was provided, the frequency of ry mutations was still high and no HR products were recovered.
we show that fork progression is enhanced in the absence of both Drosophila Rad51 homologs, spindle-A and spindle-B, revealing homologous recombination is active and actually impairs fork movement during follicle cell rereplication

Data show that extra tracheal sprouting during hypoxia depends on the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-alpha homolog Sima and on the HIF-prolyl hydroxylase Fatiga that operates as an oxygen sensor.
Results suggest that HIFalpha/Sima nucleo-cytoplasmic localization is the result of a dynamic equilibrium between nuclear import and nuclear export, and nuclear export is modulated by oxygen tension.
fgaB but not fgaA is induced in hypoxia, in a Sima-dependent manner, through a HIF-Responsive Element localized in the first intron of fgaA
HSF binds to nmnat promoter and induces NMNAT expression under heat shock. In contrast, under hypoxia, HIF1alpha up-regulates NMNAT indirectly through the induction of HSF
crystal cells express elevated levels of Sima protein orthologous to Hif-alpha; in these cells, Sima activates Notch receptor signaling by a ligand-independent mechanism that promotes hemocyte survival during hematopoietic development and hypoxic stress
These results indicate that HIF-1alpha is required to restrain the NF-kappaB response, and thus prevents excessive and damaging pro-inflammatory responses.
Musashi is a novel regulator of HIF that inhibits responses to hypoxia specifically when oxygen is available.
miR-190 is a novel regulator of the hypoxia response that represses the oxygen sensor Fatiga, leading to HIFalpha stabilization and enhancement of hypoxic responses.
most HIF1A targets require either TIP60, the CDK8-Mediator complex, or both as coactivators for full expression in hypoxia.
In the mutant for Trh smaller synaptic boutons form clusters named satellite boutons appear at larval neuromuscular junctions, which is induced by the reduction of internal oxygen levels due to defective tracheal branches. Sima is critical in mediating hypoxia-induced satellite bouton formation. Sima upregulates the level of the Wg signal in glia, leading to reorganized microtubule structures within presynaptic sites.

Results show that hdc expression in the lymph gland is developmentally regulated, and plays an indispensable role in blocking premature lamellocyte differentiation. Hdc acts in the posterior signaling center, upstream of the Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic regulatory pathways, which normally maintain the prohemocyte state of medullary zone cells.

Zfh1 is required for ventral motor axon exit from the CNS.
An eve-->grn-->zfh1 genetic cascade is unique to one of the intersegmental motoneurons, the aCC.
Our observations on the regulation of Zfh-1 provide a new approach for examining the function of Zfh-1 in motor neurons and larval locomotion.
Study shows that Zfh1 cell autonomously regulates motoneuronal outgrowth and larval growth of neuromuscular junctions and that the growth of NMJs is dependent on the dosage of Zfh1.
Zfh-1 is a presumptive somatic target of Jak/STAT signaling, demonstrating that it is necessary and sufficient to maintain somatic stem cells.
Data show that cell fate decisions in the dorsal and lateral Twi- and Tin-positive mesoderm of Drosophila melanogaster depend on the antagonistic action of the transcription factor Lame duck and the zinc finger homeodomain factor Zfh1.

the Salvador-Warts-Hippo pathway has a cell-autonomous function to prevent inappropriate differentiation due to transcription factor imbalance and monitors the intrinsic developmental status of progenitor cells
In the normal epithelium, JNK signaling antagonizes the Hippo pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) through elevation of Warts activity, thereby suppressing tissue growth. In contrast, in the presence of hyperactive Ras, JNK signaling enhances Yki activation by accumulating F-actin through the activity of the LIM domain protein Ajuba, thereby promoting tissue growth.
Yorkie activity is controlled by LKB1/AMPK and the Hippo/Warts cascade in the central nervous system
Wts activation in wing disc epithelial cells occurs at sub-apical junctions where Hpo, Sav, Ex and Wts overlap.
Rae1 increases activation of the core kinases Hippo and Warts and plays a post-transcriptional role to increase the protein levels of the Merlin, Hippo, and Warts components of the pathway; therefore, in addition to Rae1 coordinating organ size regulation with proliferative control, we propose that Rae1 also acts in a feedback circuit to regulate pathway homeostas
In this work, we have explored the disc autonomous function of TGFbeta that promotes wing imaginal disc growth. We have studied the genetic interactions between TGFbeta signaling and other pathways regulating wing disc growth, such as the Insulin and Hippo/Salvador/Warts pathways, as well as cell cycle regulators.
Wts mediates effects of insulin and the neuropeptide prothoracicotropic hormone on regulation of ecdysone production through Yorkie and the microRNA bantam. Thus coupling insulin signaling with ecdysone production to adjust systemic growth in response to nutritional conditions during development.

DJ-1beta protein is biochemically responsive to oxidative stress, and mutant DJ-1 flies are selectively sensitive to environmental toxins associated with Parkinson's disease.
Loss-of-function DJ-1beta mutants demonstrated an extended survival of dopaminergic neurons and resistance to paraquat stress, but showed acute sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide treatment.
Data show that human DJ-1 rescues flies mutant for DJ-1b; a conserved cysteine in is critical for antioxidant function, and suggest that overoxidation of DJ-1 with age and exposure to oxidants can cause inactivation.
Flies deleted for DJ-1 manifest similar defects as pink1 and parkin mutants: male sterility, shortened lifespan, and reduced climbing ability.

Data suggest that Cindr and Anillin cooperate to promote intercellular bridge stability during incomplete cytokinesis in Drosophila melanogaster.
Cindr-mediated regulation of Arf6 is a widely used mechanism in emerging epithelia. Cindr forms a physical complex with Asap
Cindr recapitulates both proposed functions of its mammalian orthologs Cd2ap and Cin85: targeting the IgCAMs Rst and Hbs for endocytosis and stabilizing these heterophilic IgCAM complexes.
Cindr co-localizes with Anillin at mitotic and meiotic ring canals and is recruited to the contractile ring by Anillin during male germ cell meiotic cytokinesis.
correct Cindr-dJNK stoichiometry is essential to maintain epithelial integrity and disturbing this balance may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease states, including cancer
Silencing Cindr in nephrocytes led to dramatic nephrocyte functional impairment and shortened life span, as well as collapse of nephrocyte lacunar channels and effacement of nephrocyte slit diaphragms. These phenotypes could be rescued by expression of a wild-type human CD2AP gene, but not a mutant allele derived from a patient with CD2AP-associated NS.

TTK69 is required for early (before the end of stage 4) repression of tll transcription.
the Torso RTK pathway has a role in downregulation of Capicua repression and tailless activation in the Drosophila embryo
Tailless-mediated repression of kni expression is impaired in brakeless mutants.
Mutations of tll progressively impair cell cycle in MB-Nbs and cause premature loss of MB-Nbs in the early pupal stage. TLL is also expressed in MB-GMCs to prevent apoptosis and promote cell cycling. Ectopic expression of tll leads to brain tumors.
drm is activated under the control of tll and triggers development of the small intestine cell-non-autonomously through some extracellular signaling
Both position and timing of posterior segmentation gene expression domains vary strongly from embryo-to-embryo in tll mutants.
Knockdown of Atrophin, a Tll co-repressor, also increases aggression, and both proteins physically interact in the PI. tll knockdown-induced aggression is fully suppressed by blocking neuropeptide processing or release from the PI
tll regulates the precise timing of the transition from neuroepithelial cells to medulla neuroblasts; tll has a crucial role for the specification of lamina precursor cells
We then show that Rx controls proliferation within the MBNB clones independently of Tailless (Tll) and Prospero (Pros), and does not regulate the expression of other key regulators of MB development, Eyeless (Ey) and Dachshund (Dac). Our data support that the role of Rx in forebrain development is conserved between vertebrates and fly.

upregulation of Nebula/DSCR1 is neuroprotective in the presence of APP upregulation and provides evidence for calcineurin inhibition as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in preventing axonal transport impairments associated with AD.
results suggest a key role for calcineurin in cardiac remodeling during long-term hypoxia with implications for diseases of chronic hypoxia, and it likely contributes to mechanisms underlying these disease states.
Role for Slimb in the degradation of Drosophila Period protein phosphorylated by Doubletime
expression of DBT in Drosophila S2 cells produced a CKI-7-sensitive kinase activity which was reduced by both the dbt(S) and dbt(L) mutations of circadian rhythm
doubletime and CKII kinases collaborate to potentiate Drosophila PER transcriptional repressor activity
Dco coordinates tissue size by stimulating cell division/growth and blocking apoptosis via activation of DIAP1 expression.
This first analysis of adult flies with a virtual lack of DBT activity demonstrates that DBT's kinase activity is necessary for normal circadian rhythms and that a general reduction of DBT kinase activity does not produce short periods.
human casein kinase 1 epsilon cannot replace the activity of dbt in flies despite the high degree of similarity in primary sequence and kinase function
a key step in controlling the speed of the clock is phosphorylation of an N-terminal Ser (S47) by DBT, which collaborates with other nearby phosphorylated residues to generate a high-affinity atypical SLIMB-binding site on PER.
heterozygous mutations of this gene, which encodes the major catalytic subunit of PKA (cAMP-dependent kinase), delayed AMI onset by more than 2-fold without affecting lifespan and memory at young age.(review)

Mutation of ck1alpha or -epsilon or sgg/gsk3beta in wing imaginal discs results in the accumulation of dMyc protein, suggesting a physiological role for these kinases in vivo.
Results suggest that Dachsous regulates discs overgrown-dependent phosphorylation of Fat and Fat-associated proteins to control Fat signaling in growth and planar cell polarity.
These results suggest that DBT regulates phosphorylation, stability and localization of PDP1epsilon, and that it has multiple targets in the Drosophila circadian system.
The introduction of CKI-epsilon point mutation L39Q, found in human breast cancer, into the fly homolog dco causes an overgrowth phenotype in imaginal disc tissue. Adding S101R, modifies the mutant phenotype so that the affected tissue disintegrates.
kinetics of PER degradation with DBT(S) in cell culture resembles that with wild-type DBT and posits that, in flies DBT(S) likely does not modulate the clock by simply affecting PER degradation kinetics
Data demonstrate that overall reduction of DBT causes long and arrhythmic behavior revealing an unexpected role in promoting synchrony of the circadian clock network.
Responses of the clock to light via the regulated translation of DBT.
Data show that the HSP-90 cochaperone spaghetti protein (SPAG) antagonizes casein kinase I epsilon DBT autophosphorylation in S2 cells
we show that spag knock-down or reduced Dbt activity in circadian cells leads to longer circadian periods and expression of activated initiator caspase only during the middle of the day.
results demonstrate that Bride of Doubletime (BDBT) interacts with doubletime(DBT)in a manner requiring the DBT nuclear localization signal for nuclear localization and that the interaction is required to produce a fully functional circadian complex
Phosphorylation of PER residue S589 stabilizes and activates PER inhibitory function in the presence of TIM, but promotes PER degradation in its absence. The role of DBT in regulating PER activity, stabilization and degradation ensures that these events are chronologically and biochemically linked, and contributes to the timing of an essential delay that influences the period of the circadian clock.
DBT plays a dual role on PER in control of this core mechanism (i) by relieving the effects of PER on the transcriptional repression when it targets nuclear PER for degradation and (ii) by delaying PER's nuclear localization when targeting its degradation in the cytoplasm.
The authors conclude that Casein Kinase Iepsilon phosphorylation acts as a switch, promoting Strabismus mobility and Dishevelled immobility, thus enhancing sorting of these proteins to opposite cell edges.

identifed conserved residues within Pygopus that are required for binding to Legless in vitro and for their activity in development
Pygo and Lgs function in targeting Armadillo/beta-catenin to the nucleus, thus ensuring its availability to TCF during Wnt signalling.
Pygopus and legless provide essential transcriptional coactivator functions to armadillo/beta-catenin.
Pygopus promotes Wnt target gene transcription by recruiting the mediator complex through interactions with Med12 and Med13.
Data show that human and Drosophila Pygo PHD fingers associate with their cognate HD1 domains from BCL9/Legless to bind specifically to the histone H3 tail methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me).
Pygo predisposes Drosophila T cell factor target genes for rapid Wingless-induced transcription, or it protects them against premature shut-down
the PHD domain is required to link Drosophila Pygopus to Legless/beta-catenin and not to histone H3
Double knockdown of pygo and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II caused additional arrhythmia compared with pygo knockdown alone, suggesting that some of the effects of pygo are mediated by Ca2+ signaling.
humanized fly Pygo derepresses Notch targets, implying an inherent Notch-related function of classical Pygo orthologs, disabled in fly Pygo, which thus appears dedicated to Wnt signaling.
results are consistent with the idea that pygo functions independently of canonical Wnt signaling in the differentiation of the adult interchamber cardiac valves

interaction between the Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb Corto and Cyclin G is involved in regulating the balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation during abdominal epithelium development
Overproduction of Cyclin G produces small cells whereas shortage produces large cells, suggesting that Cyclin G negatively regulates cell growth.
Cyclin G is encoded by an essential gene, since either RNAi-disruption or cDNA overexpression resulted in high lethality.
Our results highlight the role of CycG in the control of developmental stability in D. melanogaster
CycG has a role in an early step of meiotic recombination repair.
CycG promotes Gurken-mediated activation of EGFR signalling.
CycG acts at the level of Akt1 to regulate growth and metabolism via PP2A in Drosophila.
Loss of CycG modified dominant wing phenotypes of Notch, Delta and Hairless mutants. Whereas Notch loss of function phenotype was ameliorated by a loss of CycG, phenotypes of Notch gain of function or of Delta or Hairless loss of function were enhanced
The metabolic defects of cycG mutant animals are abrogated by a concomitant loss of Wdb, CycG presumably influences Akt1 activity at the PP2A nexus; Well rounded (Wrd), another B' subunit of PP2A in Drosophila, binds CycG similar to Wdb, and that its loss ameliorates some, but not all, of the metabolic defects of cycG mutants.
Study data suggest that Drosophila melanogaster Cyclin G and the Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PR-DUB cooperate in sustaining developmental stability.

role for Pasha in miRNA maturation and miRNA-mediated gene regulation
DGCR8 is required for the maturation of miRNA primary transcripts.
Pasha is essential for the biogenesis of canonical miRNAs but is dispensable for the processing and function of mirtron-derived regulatory RNAs.
Excess Drosha cleaves pasha/DGCR8 primary transcripts and leads to a reduction in pasha/DGCR8 mRNA levels and Pasha/DGCR8 synthesis.
report clear phenotypic differences between drosha and pasha/dgcr8 null alleles in two postembryonic lineages in the Drosophila brain
Drosha and Pasha are required for coordinated development of somatic and germ cell precursors in the larval ovary. Loss of Drosha or Pasha function perturbs somatic precursor development, causing defects in formation of terminal filaments.
The synaptic functions of Kek-6 could be evolutionarily conserved. This raises the intriguing possibility that a novel mechanism of structural synaptic plasticity involving truncated Trk-family receptors independently of TyrK signaling may also operate in the human brain.
Awd is a negative regulator of ovary border-cell migration. Down-regulation allows optimal spatial signaling via Pvr & JAK/STAT. Overexpression stalls migration & reverts the phenotype of overexpressing constitutive Pvr or dominant-negative dynamin.
Data show that awd modulates the level and localization of adherens junction components via endocytosis, and is involved in regulating morphogenesis.
Awd function is required before gamma-secretase mediated cleavage since over-expression of the constitutively active form of the Notch receptor in awd mutant follicle cells allows rescue of the signaling.

Down-regulation of Shi activity enhances extracellular Awd Drosophila cell lines.
BMP type I receptor Thickveins (Tkv) internalization is facilitated by the Drosophila homolog of Nm23 (abnormal wing disks, AWD), which is upregulated in active intestinal stem cells (ISCs) by JNK signaling. The AWD-facilitated endocytosis of Tkv is critical for the return of ISCs to quiescence, to prevent epithelial dysplasia, and for host survival during acute intestinal infection.

Results indicate that the ability of faf, hiw or Rdl to modulate sleep and protect against cognitive impairments during waking is circuit dependent. Decreasing hiw and Rdl within the Mushroom Bodies protects against the negative effects of sleep deprivation as indicated by the absence of a subsequent homeostatic response, or deficits in short-term memory.
ACF1 facilitates HP1 binding to chromatin methylated at lysine 9 within the H3 N terminus (H3K9).

ACF1 has a role in nucleosome remodeling during Drosophila oogenesis
global knockdown of the single Drosophila melanogaster riboflavin transporter homologue revealed reduced levels of riboflavin, downstream metabolites, and electron transport chain complex I activity.

Riboflavin transporter knockdown in Drosophila also resulted in severely impaired locomotor activity and reduced lifespan.
DSyd-1 might stall synaptic proteins other than DLiprin-, e.g., adhesion molecules, to regulate postsynaptic maturation in a trans-synaptic manner.
cooperation between Syd-1 and Nrx-1 seems to orchestrate early assembly processes between pre- and postsynaptic membranes
The Syd-1/liprin-alpha/PP2A pathway stabilizes the active zone in synaptic terminals.
Our live data support a "serial synapse formation" model, where at any time point only 1-2 "synaptogenic" filopodia suppress the synaptic competence of other filopodia through competition for synaptic seeding factors. Loss of the synaptic seeding factors Syd-1 and Liprin-alpha leads to a loss of this suppression, filopodial destabilization, and reduced synapse formation.

nervy regulates repulsive axon guidance by linking the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the Semaphorin 1a receptor Plexin A
PlexB is a receptor for the secreted semaphorin Sema-2a
Semaphorin 2a secreted by oenocytes signals through plexin B and plexin A to guide sensory axons in the Drosophila embryo, with PlexB play the major signaling role.
PlexinA functions to suppress excessive axonal branches and synapses and PlexinB facilitates axonal growth.
In the absence of PlexB, chordotonal afferent connectivity within the CNS is severely disrupted, resulting in specific larval behavioral deficits.
This study demonstrated that the evidence that PlexB mediates not only Sema-2a/2b-dependent guidance functions, but also Sema-2a/2b-independent target recognition in establishing the segmental nerve a motor axon pathway.
semaphorin 2b is a target-derived signal that acts upon presynaptic plexin B receptors to mediate the retrograde, homeostatic control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila; Sema2b-PlexB signalling regulates presynaptic homeostatic plasticity through the cytoplasmic protein Mical and the oxoreductase-dependent control of presynaptic actin
PlexB plays a multifaceted role in instructing the assembly of the Drosophila olfactory circuit through temporally-regulated expression patterns and expression level-dependent effects.
extracellular PlexB cleavage serves as a regulatory mechanism of PlexB signaling. Thus, the divergent roles of PlexB motifs in distinct steps of neural development contribute to its functional versatility in neural circuit assembly.
Secreted semaphorin 2b (Sema-2b) acts through its transmembrane receptor Plexin B (PlexB) to locally attract neural processes to specific fan-shaped body (FB) laminae. Aberrant Sema-2b/PlexB signaling leads to select disruptions in neural lamination, and these disruptions result in the formation of ectopic inhibitory connections between subsets of FB neurons.
The function of this transcription factor is regulated by a Ci complex that is part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.
Sgg/GSK3 acts in conjunction with PKA to cause hyperphosphorylation of Ci, which targets it for proteolytic processing, and that Hh opposes Ci proteolysis by promoting its dephosphorylation.

Distinct protein degradation mechanisms mediated by Cul1 and Cul3 controlling Ci stability in Drosophila eye development.
ci mediates hedgehog signaling to determine the anteroposterior compartment of Drosophila wing disc.
Data show that the Costal2-Fused-Cubitus interruptus (Cos2-Fu-Ci) protein complex is associated with Smoothened (Smo) in membrane fractions, and that Cos2 binding on Smo is necessary for the Hedgehog-dependent dissociation of Ci from this complex.
Engrailed is responsible for the establishment of ci repression early during embryonic development and is also required to maintain the repression of ci throughout development.
Cos2 recruits multiple kinases to efficiently phosphorylate Ci, and Hh inhibits Ci phosphorylation by specifically interfering with kinase recruitment.
Two unrelated transcription factors, Ci and NF-kappaB, use the same mechanism to undergo partial degradation by the proteasome in vivo.
Su(fu) protein levels and isoforms are crucial for the modulation of the different Ci states that control Hh target gene expression.
Data suggest that, after activation of Smoothened, the Fused kinase induces a conformational change in Costal2 that allows the disassembly of the Smo-Fu-Cos2-Cubitus interruptus complex and consequent activation of Hedgehog target genes.
Ci proteolysis is compromised, its specific activity is limited principally by Su(fu), and not by Cos2 cytoplasmic tethering or PKA phosphorylation.
Results present a model whereby the zinc finger region and lysine 750 together form a unique protection signal that prevents the complete degradation of Cubitus interruptus by the proteasome.
Cos2 motility regulates the amounts and activity of Ci that ultimately interpret the level of Hh to which cells are exposed.

The last 3 zinc fingers of Ci-155 bind Cos2 in vitro. The zinc finger region, rather than the CDN domain, functions redundantly with the CORD domain to promote Hh-regulated Ci-155 proteolysis in wing discs.
CK2 regulated the stability of full-length Cubitus interruptus (Ci).
two different mechanisms by which Rdx negatively regulates Ci may play an important role in the fine-tuning of Hh responses
Transduction of the Hedgehog signal through the dimerization of Fused and the nuclear translocation of Cubitus interruptus.
Hh-induced Smo conformational change facilitates the assembly of active Smo-Cos2-Fu signaling complexes that promote Fu kinase domain dimerization, phosphorylation and activation; Fu regulates both the activator and repressor forms of Ci
Ter94 ATPase and K11-linked ubiquitination in Ci contribute to the selectivity by proteasomes for partial degradation.
The requirement for gene activation by Ci in the regions of low-to-moderate Hh signalling results in evolutionary pressure favouring weak binding sites in enhancers of certain Hh target genes.
Kto-Skd affects the A/P-axial development of the whole wing disc. Kto can interact with Cubitus interruptus (Ci), bind to the Ci-binding region on ptc promoter, which are both regulated by Hh signals to down-regulate ptc expression.
the expression of aPKC is up-regulated by Hh signaling in a Ci-dependent manner
Ci responds to and relays Hh signals in a precise manner to control target genes expressions and ensures proper Hh signal transduction.
study not only reveals an unanticipated and conserved mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ci/Gli positively regulates Hh signaling
Data show that normal Ci-155 activation by Hh requires Cos2 binding to Fu, supporting the hypothesis that Cos2 mediates the apposition of Fu molecules suitable for cross-phosphorylation and consequent full activation of Fu kinase.

Data show that wingless (wg) represses transcription of the dpp gene in the ventral leg disc, and that this repression requires a tri-partite complex of the WG mediators armadillo and dTCF, and the co-repressor Brinker.
SoxN repression is potentiated by adding ectopic Tcf, suggesting that SoxN interacts with the repressor form of Tcf to influence Wg/Wnt target gene transcription.
A combinatorial enhancer recognized by Mad, TCF, and Brk first activates then represses dpp expression in the posterior spiracles of Drosophila.
This study suggests that the sequence of TCF-binding sites allosterically regulates the TCF/Arm complex to effect either transcriptional activation or repression.
data suggest that DNA recognition by TCF occurs through a bipartite mechanism, involving both the HMG domain and the C-clamp, which enables TCF to locate and activate Wnt response elements in the nucleus
Bone morphogenetic protein pathway components can repress Wg target gene expression by influencing the binding of Arm and dTcf.
Coop (corepressor of Pan) is a Pangolin-interacting protein
The DNA binding ability of the C-clamp domain of pangolin is functionally important for patterning the drosophila embryo.
TCF/Pangolin (the fly TCF) and some vertebrate TCF isoforms bind DNA through two distinct domains, a High Mobility Group (HMG) domain and a C-clamp, which recognize DNA motifs known as HMG and Helper sites, respectively.
The type of HMG and Helper sites is sufficient to direct activation or repression of Wnt regulated cis-regulatory modules, and protease digestion studies suggest that TCF/Pangolin adopts distinct conformations when bound to either HMG-Helper site pair
Requirement of Pangolin for transcriptional regulation of Wingless target genes.Pan regulates Wnt/Wg-responsive enhancers.
We identify the conserved transcription factors Sox box protein 15 (Sox15) and Ftz transcription factor 1 (Ftz-f1) as genes controlled by dTcf/Pan involved in tumor development. In conclusion, this study reports a role for dTcf/Pan as a repressor of normal and oncogenic growth and identifies the genes inducing tumorigenesis downstream of dTcf/Pan.

Through DnaJ-1, our data connect ataxin-3 and Rad23 to protective processes involved with protein folding rather than increased turnover of toxic polyQ species.

We identified the TGFbeta family member Maverick (Mav) as a ligand for Gfrl and a Mav chromosomal deficiency displayed similar embryonic ENS defects. Results suggest that the Ret and Gfrl families co-evolved before the separation of invertebrate and vertebrate lineages.
GW182 links the miRNA pathway to mRNA degradation
This suggests that gawky represents a previously unknown member of a small group of genes that need to be expressed zygotically during early embryo development.
deletion of the RNA recognition motif impairs the silencing activity of GW182 in a miRNA target-specific manner, indicating that this domain contributes to silencing.
Using both tethered function and complementation assays, study identified 3 independent domains of the Drosophila GW182 protein (also termed Gawky) that are sufficient to repress mRNA.
model proposed in which the GW182 silencing domain promotes translational repression, at least in part, by interfering with mRNA circularization and also recruits the deadenylase complex through the interaction with PABPC1
HPat binds to and copurifies with GW182.
Multiple GW/WG repeats present in the minimal N-terminal repressor domain of Drosophila GW182 are required for target mRNA repression.
Data demonstrate that in human and Drosophila melanogaster cells, the critical repressive features of both the N-terminal and C-terminal effector domains of GW182 proteins are Gly/Ser/Thr-Trp (G/S/TW) or Trp-Gly/Ser/Thr (WG/S/T) motifs.
MicroRNAs utilize at least three distinct silencing pathways: GW182-mediated deadenylation and GW182-dependent and -independent repression of early translation initiation.
miRNA-mediated translational repression and degradation are mechanistically linked and are triggered through the interactions of GW182 with poly(A)-binding protein and deadenylases.
Gawky plays a critical role in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. (Review)

Pax6 initiates both eye specification and proliferation
Eyeless uncouples mushroom body neuroblast proliferation from dietary amino acids in Drosophila.
This study set Hipk and the master regulators Toy and Ey in an enzyme-substrate relationship. The interaction and phosphorylation of the master regulator Toy by Hipk may be important for precise tuning of signalling within the retinal determination gene network and therefore for Drosophila eye development.
The loss of Pax6, but not of Eya, is required for Sfmbt dependent eye-to-wing transformation.
Loss of Ey within the peripodial epithelium leads to the loss of dpp expression within the eye, failure of the furrow to initiate, and abrogation of retinal development. These findings reveal an unexpected mechanism for how Pax6 controls eye development in Drosophila.
Ey could use multiple molecular mechanisms to regulate target gene expression and pathway function, which might enable Ey to exhibit a greater flexibility in controlling different processes during eye development
We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.
changes in the temporal regulation of the highly conserved eyeless/Pax6 gene expression during development is a conserved mechanism for sensory trade-offs within and between Drosophila species.

Activin signaling regulates postsynaptic membrane potential and GluRIIA/B abundance at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction
a conserved role for activin in enhancing adipokinetic hormone/glucagon signaling and glycemic control, is reported.
The authors find that both arms of the TFGb signaling pathways specifically instruct the pale photoreceptor subset in R8.

CAMKII is activated by eag potassium channel
The sedative action of diazepam is correlated with selective down-regulation of transcripts involved in regulation of neuronal plasticity and neurotrophic responses. Most transcript changes were transient except for decrease of the CaMKIIalpha transcript
Morphological studies indicate that CaMKII activation in fact reduces postsynaptic sites at 8 h after hatching . This is opposite to the effect observed in larvae just after hatching.
a subpopulation of noncholinergic, nondopaminergic, non-GABAergic neurons can cause CaMKII-dependent reductions in initial courtship, but only cholinergic neurons enhance training-dependent suppression.
CaMKII-induced modulation was independent of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling that is important for retrograde control at mature larvae.
CaMKII is involved in the negative regulation of the visual response affecting light adaptation, possibly by catalyzing phosphorylation of Arr2
We found that postsynaptic CaMKII regulates the localization of GluRIIA and GluRIIB, we hypothesize that postsynaptic CaMKII activity monitors the calcium influx through GluRIIA and regulate the amount of synaptic GluRIIA during larval stages
This study indicated a role for patterned electrical activity and presynaptic calcium signaling, acting through CaMKII, in modulating a retrograde signal during the refinement of synaptic connections.
These results suggest that presynaptic CaMKII activation depends on autophosphorylation and global Ca(2+) in the terminal, while translocation to AZs requires Ca(2+) microdomains generated by IP3Rs.
Regulated CaMKII autophosphorylation appears essential in central synapse development, and particular cholinergic synapses are affected differentially, although they operate via the same nicotinic receptor.
It is NMDA receptor downstream kinase and essential for memory and learning acquisition.(review)

This study set Hipk and the master regulators Toy and Ey in an enzyme-substrate relationship. The interaction and phosphorylation of the master regulator Toy by Hipk may be important for precise tuning of signalling within the retinal determination gene network and therefore for Drosophila eye development.
Fuss exerts a pivotal role as an antagonist of BMP signaling in Drosophila melanogaster.[Fussel]
Analyses of dCORL mutant mated adult brains revealed a complete rescue of dILP2 neurons without Drifter. Taken together, the data suggest that dCORL participates in a neural network connecting the insulin signaling pathway, longevity and mating.
Fuss interacts with Rpd3, and downregulation of rpd3 in gustatory neurons phenocopies the loss of Fuss expression. Surprisingly, there is no colocalization of Fuss with phosphorylated Mad in the larval central nervous system, excluding a direct involvement of Fuss in Dpp/BMP signaling.

Stable Positioning of Unc13 Restricts Synaptic Vesicle Fusion to Defined Release Sites to Promote Synchronous Neurotransmission
Study shows that ethanol regulates presynaptic activity and sedation through presynaptic unc13 proteins in drosophila.

CG11148 is known as GYF; its product is orthologous to GIGYF1 (GRB10-interacting GYF protein 1) and GIGYF2 in mammals, and it is a new autophagy regulator
When in complex with 4EHP, GIGYF not only elicits translational repression but also promotes target mRNA decay via the recruitment of additional effector proteins.

results show silencing of Sox102F, the Drosophila ortholog of SOX5, resulted in severe cardiac dysfunction and structural defects with disrupted Wnt signaling transduction; this implicates an important functional role for SOX5 in heart and suggests that alterations in SOX5 levels may contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple cardiac diseases or traits
To characterize the neuronal role of SOX5, we silenced the Drosophila ortholog of SOX5, Sox102F, by RNAi in various neuronal subtypes in Drosophila. Silencing of Sox102F led to misorientated and disorganized michrochaetes, neurons with shorter dendritic arborization (DA) and reduced complexity, diminished larval peristaltic contractions, loss of neuromuscular junction bouton structures, impaired olfactory perception
findings suggest that SoxD regulates neurite guidance, without affecting neuronal fate.

demonstrate that the histone acetyl transferase CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 (Ep300) in humans acetylate H3K56
A careful study of the dCBP mutations provides evidence that dCBP does not affect the formation and/or function of centric heterochromatin and thus may affect other dSIR2 functions.
We conclude that CBP occupancy in Drosophila embryos preferentially overlaps factors controlling dorso-ventral patterning and that CBP binds silent genes without causing histone hyperacetylation.
data suggest that Chm and CBP might function both locally at the amplicon origins and globally in the developmental transition of follicle cells into the amplification stage of oogenesis
BHQ domain of CBP is responsible for its neuroprotective function.
a novel activity of polycomb: inhibition of the histone acetylation activity of CREB-binding protein, is identified.
Drosophila genetic experiments demonstrated interaction between SMARCAD1/Etl1 and CBP/nej during development. The interplay between the remodeling activity of SMARCAD1 and histone acetylation by CBP sheds light on the function of chromatin and the genome-integrity network.
En forms a complex with Nejire (Nej), the Drosophila ortholog of histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300, and directs Nej to this cis-regulatory region where Nej functions as the co-activator for dpp expression.
CBP directly stimulates both RNA polymerase II recruitment and the ability to traverse the first nucleosome, thereby promoting transcription of most genes.
With respect to the histone-to-protamine transition, study proposes that Nejire regulates transcript levels for sperm relevant proteins in spermatocytes and in directly or indirectly acetylation of H3K18 and H3K27 for fully efficient histone degradation.
histone H3 lysine acetylation catalysed by the acetyltransferases dCBP, contributes to Drosophila learning, likely by controlling the expression of specific genes.
Trx, Ash1, and CBP proteins are required for the correct chromosome segregation and that Ash1 and CBP mediate for Cid/CENP-A recruitment at centromeres through post-translational histone modifications. Centromeric H3 histone is consistently acetylated in K27 by CBP and that nej and ash1 silencing respectively causes a decrease in H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 methylation along with an impairment of Cid loading.

Mechanistically, Ret is engaged in a positive feedback loop with Wnt/Wingless signalling, modulated by Src and Fak kinases.
Gfrl shares the same enteric nervous system (ENS) and feeding defects with Ret, suggesting that Ret and Gfrl might function together via a common ligand. We identified the TGFbeta family member Maverick (Mav) as a ligand for Gfrl and a Mav chromosomal deficiency displayed similar embryonic ENS defects.

These results raise the possibility that muscle is one of major tissues in which AMPK plays a critical role on longevity and stress resistance.
AMPK supports growth in Drosophila by regulating muscle activity and nutrient uptake in the gut
AMPK gamma and alpha mutants altered lipid metabolism and showed persistent starvation behaviors.
Data suggest that that an Sgt1/Hsp90-LKB1-AMPK pathway acts redundantly with a microtubule-induced polarity pathway to generate neuroblast cortical polarity, and the absence of neuroblast cortical polarity can produce neuroblast tumors.
The significance of these findings is that AMPK is important in the regulation of glucagon signaling, suggesting that the organization of metabolic networks is highly conserved and that AMPK plays a prominent role in these networks.
Loss of AMPK activity exacerbates neuronal loss and associated phenotypes in parkin and LRRK transgenic flies.
AMPK can function outside of its canonical nutrient-sensing role in specific developmental contexts.

Alternative splicing of the lola gene creates a family of 19 transcription factors and explains how a small genome encodes all the information that is necessary to specify the enormous diversity of axonal trajectories.
the eyeful P-element insertion, which induces overexpression of lola and psq, combined with Delta overexpression induces metastatic tumors
lola plays a critical role in programmed cell death in the ovary
We propose that Lola functions as a general transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes ultimately controlling PN identity and wiring specificity.
Lola antagonizes Notch-dependent gene expression and Notch-dependent fate transformation. Expression analysis shows that Lola is constitutively present in all photoreceptors and cone cells
alternatively spliced isoforms control self-renewal in neuroblast lineages
Lola suppresses expression of the actin nucleation factor Spire, and this is crucial for its ability to promote growth of motor axons in vivo.
Different lola isoforms, each having unique C-termini and zinc finger domains, may control different aspects of proliferation and differentiation in the male germline and somatic cyst stem cell lineages.
Loss of Lola Causes Brain Tumors.
Mid and Lola are required for somatic gonadal precursor cell cluster fusion, germ cell ensheathment, and gonad compaction in the developing Drosophila gonads.

Drosophila APC2 and APC1 play overlapping roles in wingless signaling in the embryo and imaginal discs.
results show that dividing male germline stem cells use mechanisms involving centrosome function and cortically localized APC to orient mitotic spindles ensuring an asymmetric outcome in which one cell self renews and the other initiates differentiation
Results show that although complete loss of APC1 and APC2 resulted in activation of Wingless signaling, it did not alter cell viability, cadherin-based adhesion, spindle morphology, orientation or selection of division plane, as predicted.
findings demonstrate that Drosophila Apc homologs have an activating role in both physiological and ectopic Wingless signaling; Apc likely promotes Wingless transduction through down-regulation of Axin, a negative regulator of Wingless signaling
Apc activity is not present in vast excess, but instead is near the minimal level required for accurate graded responses to the Wingless morphogen.
APCs are not essential for asymmetric cell division or the stereotyped division axis of central brain (CB) neuroblasts, although they do affect cell cycle progression and spindle architecture.

We conclude that even in the unstimulated state, a pool of Axin forms membrane-proximal puncta that are dependent on Apc, and that membrane association regulates both Axin levels and Axin's role in the rapid activation of signaling that follows Wnt exposure.
in the adult intestine, Ebd acts independently of Ewg in physiological Wnt signaling, but cooperates with Ewg to induce the hyperactivation of Wnt target gene expression following Apc1 loss. These findings have relevance for human tumorigenesis, as Jerky (JRK/JH8), the human Ebd homolog, promotes Wnt pathway hyperactivation and is overexpressed in colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancers
Novel requirement for APC in Axin regulation through phosphorylation both prevents signaling in the Wnt-off state and promotes signaling immediately following Wnt stimulation.

Results indicate that, in vivo, clockwork orange (CWO) modulates clock gene expression through both repressor and activator transcriptional functions.
Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) antagonizes CLK-CYC E-box binding, thus enhancing the removal of CLK-CYC from E-boxes to maintain transcriptional repression. This process requires PER, which suggests that PER-TIM and CWO cooperate to maintain a transcriptionally repressed state by removing CLK-CYC from E-boxes
results show that LK6 binds to ERK and is activated by ERK signalling and it is responsible for phosphorylating eIF4E in Drosophila
Lk6 exerts a tight control on Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E phosphorylation and is necessary for normal growth and development.

Results show that it is via Lk6, regulators of the translation factor eIF4E, FOXO and TOR also converge to regulate protein synthesis.
The roX1 and roX2 genes produce redundant, male-specific lethal transcripts required for targeting the MSL complex.

san is required in vivo for normal mitosis of different types of somatic cells.

Also, the results suggest a working model where Naa50/San N-terminally acetylates the nascent Scc1 polypeptide, which is subsequently required for the correct establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion.

The previously observed ability of TAN to move between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and to associate with DNA, provides a potential mechanism for TAN to respond to N signalling.
Tan expression is confined to the photoreceptor cells R1-R8.
Hybridization tests using D. melanogaster deficiencies that include tan show no evidence that this locus is involved in the lighter pigmentation of D. santomea females; rather, the pigmentation difference appears to involve at least 4 other loci.
In contrast to NBAD-synthase, Tan is expressed constitutively in epidermis and does not respond directly to microbial challenge. The study shows the novel localization of tan in embryo central neural system and in different regions of adult brain.

Crumbs localisation in the principal cells of the hindgut depends on Stardust. In contrast, localisation of Crumbs in the boundary cells does not require Stardust and is independent of its PDZ domain- and FERM-domain binding motifs.
The adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex binds to a motif in the cytoplasmic tail of Crumbs that overlaps with the binding site of Stardust, a protein known to stabilize Crumbs on the surface.
The E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuralized promotes the endocytosis of Crumbs via the NBM-containing isoforms of Stardust.

Causes of the observed pattern of nucleotide variation in the gustatory receptor Gr5a gene.

single P-element insertions in the intergenic region between Gr5a and Tre1 exert complex pleiotropic effects on fitness traits, including selective nutrient intake, life span, and resistance to starvation and heat stress
Gustator receptors would be candidate sugar receptors because Gr5a-expressing cells function in the responses to attractive tastants.

Mutations in the steroid-regulated genes BR-C and E93 differentially impact larval midgut cell death but do not affect the formation of adult midgut epithelia
E93 likely controls the responsiveness of many other target genes because it is required broadly for patterning during metamorphosis.
Autophagy and caspase activity are induced by 20E and predominantly transduced by E93 in the remodeling fat body of Drosophila.
Here, we show that the transcription factor E93 is the key determinant that promotes adult metamorphosis in both hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects, thus acting as the universal adult specifier.

Data find that the conserved factor Zfrp8/PDCD2 is essential for the maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cells, but dispensable for their daughter cells, the pluripotent precursors.
The piRNA pathway is essential in early oogenesis, and we find that nuclear localization of Zfrp8 in germline stem cells and their offspring is regulated by some piRNA pathway genes.
demonstrate that Zfrp8 genetically interacts with Fmr1 and tral in an antagonistic manner. Zfrp8 and FMRP both control heterochromatin packaging, also in opposite ways

Results describe a Frizzled-Dishevelled-NuMA/Mud pathway that orients division from Drosophila to vertebrates.
The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the Ft/Ds pathway in the context of Fz planar cell polarity signaling model.
Data show that ds and fz contribute independently to planar polarity in the Drosophila ventral epidermis and that they do so over spatially distinct domains.
Knockdown of Tc-fz1 alone interfered with the formation of the proximo-distal and the dorso-ventral axes during leg development, whereas no effect was observed with single Tc-fz2 or Tc-fz4 RNAi knockdowns.

Intrinsic control of muscle attachment sites matching.
The results suggest that trol acts in the extracellular matrix and binds, stores, and sequesters external signals and, thereby, participates in the stage- and region-specific control of neuroblast proliferation.
Trol can mediate signaling through both of the FGF and Hedgehog pathways to control the onset of stem cell proliferation in the developing nervous system.
The intrinsic control over myogenic programs can only be overridden by FGF4 signals provided by the apical ectodermal ridge of a developing limb.
The interaction of perlecan and dystroglycan at the basal side of the epithelium promotes basal membrane differentiation and is required for maintenance of cell polarity in the follicle-cell epithelium.

Pk mediates feedback amplification to generate asymmetric planar cell polarity signaling in Drosophila.

Fat and Core planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways patterns change during morphogenesis, undergoing phases of coupling and uncoupling that are regulated by antagonistic Core PCP protein isoforms Prickle and Spiny-legs.
We find that the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex Cullin1(Cul1)/SkpA/Supernumerary limbs(Slimb) regulates the stability of one of the peripheral membrane components, Prickle (Pk).
The stabilizing function of Prickle on Frizzled requires Prickle activity in neighboring cells. Conversely, Prickle in the same cell has a destabilizing effect on Frizzled.
Data indicate Prickle protein as a mitogen-activated protein kinase Nemo substrate.
the prickle gene and its protein products Prickle and Spiny leg can affect, separately, both Dachsous/Fat, and the 'core' or Starry night/Frizzled systems; however, neither Prickle nor Spiny leg are essential components of the Dachsous/Fat or the Starry night/Frizzled system, nor do they act as a functional link between the two systems.

results show that LK6 binds to ERK and is activated by ERK signalling and it is responsible for phosphorylating eIF4E in Drosophila
our results suggest that the level of eIF4E protein is regulated by Diap1, and that IAPs may play a role in cap-dependent translation by regulating the level of eIF4E protein.
These results suggest that the eIF4E-1,2 gene is regulated by Hfp through a mechanism linked to transcription control and 3' splice site selection, which determines the pattern and translation efficiency of eIF4E-1,2 mRNAs.
data are consistent with the idea that Parkin and eIF4E act in a common pathway, likely modulating cap-dependent translation initiation events.
eIF4E regulates the sex-specific expression of the master switch gene Sxl.
Protein-protein interactions rather than interactions with the mRNA are essential for the recruitment of eIF4E and for a putative nucleation function.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-3 is essential for meiotic chromosome segregation, cytokinesis and male fertility in Drosophila.
eIF4E-binding protein requires non-canonical 4E-binding motifs and a lateral surface of eIF4E to repress translation.
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 impairs the competition with eIF4G for eIF4E binding.
Both eIF4E-1 and eIF4E-3 are required in spermatocytes for chromosome condensation and cytokinesis during the meiotic stages.

SuUR mutation leads to earlier completion of DNA replication
Differential responses of polyploid and diploid cells to ectopic SuUR may reflect differences in the mechanisms underlying mitotic cell cycles and endocycles
SuUR binds specificialy to boundary regions and regular distribution of boundary regions in chromosomes may represent the dispersion of sites designed for chromosomal silencing
SUUR has at least two separate chromosome-binding regions that are able to recognize intercalary and pericentric heterochromatin specifically.
The SuUR gene affects the distribution of HP1 and SU(VAR)3-9 on the nurse cell poytene chromosomes.
Data on the SuUR gene, its expression, and effect on polytene chromosome structure and replication are summarized.
these results suggest that SUUR is a ubiquitous marker of heterochromatin in different cell types
describe how, in double mutants for Suppressor of variegation 3-9 and SuUR genes encoding two structural proteins of heterochromatin, new banded heterochromatic segments appear in all polytene chromosomes
it is proposed that interaction of SUUR with HP1 is crucial for the association of SUUR with chromatin
Mutation of two conserved amino acid residues in this region impairs binding of SUUR to polytene chromosomes and reduces the ability of the protein to cause DNA underreplication.
Reversible decondensation of heterochromatin regions of polytene chromosomes during ectopic expression of the SuUR gene.
Suppressor of Underreplication gene does not directely affect the replication progression
the SUUR protein is required for the SU(VAR)3-9 enzyme to bind to the salivary gland polytene chromosomes
Our findings support the idea that the effect of SUUR on replication elongation depends on the cell cycle stage and can be mediated through its physical interaction with replication fork.
SUUR protein binding correlates with gene regulation and specific chromatin types.
Recruitment of either HP1(GAL4DBD) or SUUR(GAL4DBD) resulted in delayed completion of replication
the Trim-NHL protein Mei-P26 restricts growth and proliferation in the ovarian stem cell lineage
Vas promotes germ cell differentiation by directly activating mei-P26 translation in early-stage committed cells
miRNA machinery targets Mei-P26 and regulates Myc protein levels in the Drosophila wing
Mei-P26 has distinct functions in the ovary and participates in regulating the fates of both germline stem cells and their differentiating daughters.
Thus, germ cells progress through distinct, sequential regulatory states, from Mei-P26 on/Bam off to Bam on/Mei-P26 off.
Mei-P26 associates with Bam, Bgcn and Sxl and nanos mRNA during early germline stem cell development, suggesting that this protein helps to repress the translation of nanos mRNA.
Mei-P26 mediates tissue-specific responses to Brat and dMyc activities.
Wh is a regulator of Mei-p26 in Drosophila germ cells
Serpin-27A is required to restrict the phenoloxidase activity to the site of injury or infection, preventing the insect from excessive melanization

Mutated c-Abl stimulated the formation of F-actin branches in neurites of rat embryonic cortical neurons. The reciprocal regulation between F-actin and the c-Abl tyrosine kinase may provide a mechanism for control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics
amalgam, neurotactin and the Abelson tyrosine kinase interact and affect axon pathfinding
In Abl's absence, excess actin is polymerized in apical microvilli, whereas too little actin is assembled into pseudocleavage and cellularization furrows.
a reduction in Abl gene dosage causes distal paralysis and axonal swellings
Enabled (Ena), a substrate for Abl, promotes the formation of both dendritic branches and actin-rich spine-like protrusions of dendritic arborization neurons, an effect opposite to that of Abl
Therefore, we propose that Abl and p35/p25 cooperate in promoting Cdk5-pY15, which deregulates Cdk5 activity and subcellular localization in Abeta42-triggered neurodegeneration.
Abl acts apically to suppress the accumulation of both Enabled (Ena) and actin in mesodermal cells during ventral furrow formation
These findings suggest that the reciprocal regulation of Abi phosphorylation by Abl and PTP61F may regulate the localization and stability of Abi and may regulate the formation of lamella.
These data provide new insight into how regulated Abl activity helps direct normal development and into possible biological functions of Bcr-Abl.
Thus, Calmodulin and Abelson tyrosine kinase are key signaling molecules working synergistically to transduce both midline attractive and repulsive cues.
in addition to its role as a transcription factor, Eya functions as a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase

Data suggest that abi and Abl have an antagonistic interaction in Drosophila axonogenesis and synaptogenesis, which possibly occurs through the modulation of F-actin reorganization.

Results reveal a prominent role for Abl in coordinating multiple aspects of photoreceptor morphogenesis.
During the degradation of WAVE, Hem function is opposite to that of and downstream of Abl.
Abl is required for photoreceptor cell fate maintenance, as Abl mutant photoreceptors lose neuronal markers during late pupal stages but do not re-enter a proliferative state or undergo apoptosis.
Data find that Abl interacts both physically and genetically with the Netrin receptor Frazzled, and that disrupting this interaction prevents Abl from promoting midline axon crossing.
Abl is an essential regulator for myocyte.
Abl plays a role in the organization of filamentous actin and the redistribution of the junctional protein beta-catenin at the wound margin during embryonic wound repair.
Abl/Ena signaling controls the subcellular architecture of the Golgi complex in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons through its regulation of the Golgi-associated actin cytoskeleton.
Dysregulated Dscam binds to Abl through its cytoplasmic domain to enlarge presynaptic arbors in the Drosophila fragile X syndrome model.
In conjunction with its receptor Neurotactin (Nrt) and the effector kinase Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl), Ama is necessary in parallel to the cell-autonomous Dfd pathway for the correct specification of the maxillary identity of NB6-4
The Abl tyrosine kinase signaling network controls cell migration, epithelial organization, axon patterning and other aspects of development. Abl suppresses the actin-regulatory factor Enabled, and we find that Abl also acts through the GEF Trio to stimulate the signaling activity of Rac GTPase.
Notch-Abl axonal signaling requires proteolytic cleavage events that initiate canonical Notch signaling. Some Notch protein is tyrosine phosphorylated, this form of the protein is selectively associated with Disabled and Trio, and relevant tyrosines are essential for Notch-dependent axon patterning but not for canonical Notch-dependent regulation of cell fate.

identified ort as a candidate gene encoding a histamine receptor subunit on laminar neurons, L1/L2
The native receptor at the synapse of large monopolar cells (LMC) is an hclA homomer that alone is necessary and sufficient to account for the native histamine receptors at the Drosophila photoreceptor-LMC synapse.
Study results show that both Ort and HisCl1 define two different pathways for circadian entrainment. Whereas Ort contributes through its expression in the interneurons of the optic lobe, HisCl1 mostly contributes through its expression in the Rh6-expressing retinal photoreceptors. The work thus reveals that Rh6-expressing neurons contribute to light-mediated entrainment as both photoreceptors and interneurons.
Fzr/Cdh1 is responsible for catalyzing the second phase of cyclin B destruction that occurs throughout the cell.
Data show that fzr2, although expressed in the male germline, is not expressed during mitotic divisions, and FZR, which accumulates predominantly in the cytoplasm, is clearly required during G1.
rap gene encodes Fizzy-related protein (Fzr) and regulates cell proliferation and pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye-antennal disc.
during endocycles, APC/C Fzr/Cdh1 functions to reduce the levels of the mitotic cyclins and Geminin in order to facilitate the relicensing of DNA replication origins and cell cycle progression
Rap/Fzr targets Loco for ubiquitination, thereby regulating glial differentiation in the developing nervous system.
APC/C-Fzr activity is periodically inhibited by CycE-Cdk2, to prevent relicensing in S-phase cells.
This study demonistrated that the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) co-activator fizzy-related/Cdh1 (Fzr/Cdh1) is involved in the non-autonomous control of peripheral glial migration in postmitotic Drosophila neurons.
when N activity is high, a robust RTK signal operates that uses both Ras and Rap, but when N activity is low, only a mild RTK signal is transduced and Ras alone suffices for the purpose
The role for Drosophila APC/C-Cdh1 mediated ubiquitination in regulating synaptic morphology, function and integrity of muscle structure in the peripheral nervous system.
Spd2 is also a novel APC/C Fzr substrate. For the first time demonstrated critical importance of distinct subcellular pools of APC/C activators in the spatiotemporal control of APC/C activity.
APC/C(Fzr) regulates the fusion of myoblasts as well as the mitotic exit of pericardial cells, cardioblasts and myoblasts.
we show the cell cycle regulator Fizzy-related dictates the decision between mitosis and endocycles. After injury, both cycles accurately restore tissue mass and genome content. However, in response to sustained growth signaling, only endocycles preserve epithelial architecture
results suggest that, whereas SCF(Ppa) targets the fraction of CENP-A(CID) that is not in complex with Cal1, APC/C(Cdh1) mediates also degradation of the Cal1-CENP-A(CID) complex and, thus, likely contributes to the regulation of centromeric CENP-A(CID) deposition
LATS degradation by APC/C(Cdh1) represents a previously unappreciated and evolutionarily conserved layer of Hippo signaling regulation.
The transcription factor Myc acts downstream of Fzr during endoreplication in Drosophila salivary gland.
Mutation in shibire causes male-male courtship behavior due to disruption of synaptic transmission
The shi(ts1) mutation induces a conformational change, involving the GTP binding site, that affects dynamin aggregation.
By co-expressing shibire(ts) and semaphorin 1a, data show that semaphorin 1a was one of the proteins being regulated by endocytosis and its removal was a necessary part of the program for synaptogenesis.
Dpp spreading is mediated by Dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the target tissue, suggesting that extracellular diffusion alone cannot account for Dpp dispersal
Results support a model in which Dpp moves along the cell surface by restricted extracellular diffusion involving the glypicans Dally and Dly, and that this is not blocked by the dynamin mutant shibire.
Expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire (shi) transgene in a subset of alpha/beta neurons resulted in odor-pair-specific disruption of learning.

Dynamin is critically involved in the stabilization of Clathrin- and AP2-dependent endocytic pits.
Two GTPases, Rab5 and dynamin, are required for both the increased endocytic activity and compartmentalized Ca2+ transients in the dendritic pruning of Drosophila sensory neurons.
results implicate mutant dynamin as an effective seizure suppressor, suggesting that targeting or limiting the availability of synaptic vesicles could be an effective and general method of controlling epilepsy disorders
These studies identify novel morphogenetic roles (i.e., tube closure and biased apical expansion), and expand upon established roles (i.e., cell intercalation and adhesion remodeling), for Dynamin in tubulogenesis.
Down-regulation of Shi activity enhances extracellular Awd Drosophila cell lines.
Drosophila protein Spire represents a third class of actin nucleation factor
The interaction between Spire and Cappuccino is mediated by binding of the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain from Cappuccino to the kinase noncatalytic C-lobe domain (KIND) from Spire.
Spire overexpression cannot rescue capu mutants, but prevents actin mesh disassembly at stage 10B and blocks late cytoplasmic streaming.
Crystal structures of the complexes between the actin-binding WH2 repeats of the Spire protein and actin were determined for the Spire single domain D, the double (SpirCD), triple (SpirBCD), quadruple (SpirABCD) domains, and an artificial Spire (SpirDDD).
Data suggest that the molecular and structural mechanism of actin polymerization by Spire should apply to other actin-binding proteins that contain WH2 domains in tandem.
Lola is a negative regulator of spire, derepression of spire is an important contributor to the axon stalling phenotype of embryonic motor axons in lola mutants.
Data conclude that Spir plays a crucial role in controlling dorsal vessel formation and has a function in cell division during heart tube morphogenesis.

Greatwall phosphorylates Endos at a single site, Ser68, and this is essential for Endos function
greatwall protein antagonizes protein phosphatase 2A function in both meiosis and mitosis
Nuclear localization of Greatwall is required for its function. Spatial regulation of Gwl at mitotic entry contributes to the mitotic switch.
This mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate phosphorylated Endos, and how phosphorylated Endos controls PP2A-B55.
Our results indicate that the cyclic changes in Gwl localization at mitotic entry and exit are directly regulated by the antagonistic cyclin B-Cdk1 and PP2A-Tws enzymes
Our results together demonstrate for the first time that S6KL regulates synaptic development and function by facilitating proteasomal degradation of the BMP receptor Tkv.

Deficiencies of CG15352, the gene directly upstream of e(r), are not associated with any obvious mutant phenotypes and present the possibility that it encodes a nonvital or redundant function.
the main function of Drosophila Alk during early embryogenesis is in visceral mesoderm development
localized Jeb activates Alk and the downstream Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade to specify a select group of visceral muscle precursors as muscle-patterning pioneers
Alk is the receptor for Jeb in the developing visceral mesoderm, and Jeb binding stimulates an Alk-driven, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated signalling pathway, resulting in the expression of duf needed for muscle fusion
Alk-mediated signal transduction drives the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand in vivo.
these findings suggest that Jeb/Alk signaling helps R-cell axons to shape their environment for target recognition.
Alk plays an evolutionary conserved role in ethanol-related behaviors
Alk maintains PI3-kinase signaling during nutrient restriction as its ligand, Jelly belly, is constitutively expressed from a glial cell niche surrounding neuroblasts.
These results identify dAlk as an upstream activator of dNf1-regulated Ras signaling responsible for several dNf1 defects, and they implicate human Alk as a potential therapeutic target in NF1
Role of Lmd transcription factor in visceral mesoderm development in relationship to Jeb/Alk signal transduction. Alk signalling negatively regulates Lmd activity through the MAPK cascade resulting in a relocalisation of Lmd from nucleus to cytoplasm.
This study demonistrated that Signaling through the anaplastic lymphoma kinase directly regulates neuronal survival in visual pathway.

In both models, L- as well as D-arginine enhanced the ability of wild-type pVHL and certain misfolded mutant versions of pVHL to bind ODD, the HIF-derived target peptide, reflecting restoration of pVHL function. Moreover, continuous feeding of Drosophila expressing misfolded versions of pVHL either L- or D-arginine rich diet rescued their lethal phenotype.

Exploratory activity in Drosophila requires the kurtz nonvisual arrestin.
Kurtz is a functional arrestin and translocates to the plasma membrane upon receptor activation.
Krz can directly bind and sequester an inactive form of ERK, thus preventing its activation by the upstream kinase, MEK.
the complete elimination of kurtz by genetic techniques has no major consequences in imaginal cells, but, the over-expression of Kurtz in the wing disc causes a phenotype identical to the loss of Hedgehog signalling
Krz is required for the optimal SUMO protease activity of Ulp1.
Kurtz (Krz), the Drosophila beta-arrestin2, acts in parallel with the ESCRTs 0-II pathway to sort Smo to the multivesicular bodies and lysosome-mediated degradation.

The terminal and posterior systems function coordinately to alleviate transcriptional silencing by Capicua
Capicua regulates the pattern of follicle cell fates along the dorsoventral axis by blocking the induction of appendage determinants, such as mirror, by anterior positional cues
the Torso RTK pathway has a role in downregulation of Capicua repression and tailless activation in the Drosophila embryo
ATXN1 directly binds Capicua and modulates Capicua repressor activity in Drosophila and mammalian cells, and its loss decreases the steady-state level of Capicua.
A MAPK docking site in Capicua is critical for its downregulation by Torso and EGFR RTK signaling.
findings show Capicua restricts cell growth in imaginal discs, and its levels are, in turn, downregulated by Ras signaling; thus Cic is a key downstream component in the pathway by which Ras regulates growth in imaginal discs
activating and repressive effects of Bcd and Cic, respectively, are integrated by the Bcd target gene enhancer
Cic acts on Bcd dependent enhancer elements by repression and thereby controls the posterior limit of Bcd target gene expression.
Feedback regulation by bantam on Capicua provides a means to link signal propagation by the EGFR pathway to activity of the Hippo pathway and may play an important role in integration of these two pathways in growth control.
[REVIEW] Capicua (CIC) is a key sensor of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in both Drosophila and mammals.
We propose that ERK-dependent relief of gene repression by Cic is a two-step process, in which fast reduction of repressor activity is followed by slower changes in nuclear localization and overall protein levels.
Capicua directly interacts with several corepressor-binding sites in the zerknullt ventral repression element.
Thus, Cic proteins employ distinct repressor mechanisms that are associated with discrete structural changes in the evolutionary history of this protein family.
These studies identify Cic, Pnt, and Ets21C as critical downstream effectors of EGFR signaling in Drosophila Intestinal Stem Cells
We have thus uncovered a previously unknown mechanism of down-regulation of Cic activity by Mnb and Wap, which operates independently from the ERK-mediated control of Cic. Therefore, Cic functions as an integrator of upstream signals that are essential for tissue patterning and organ growth
Data indicate that the HMG-box of Capicua (CIC) does not bind DNA alone but instead requires a distant motif (referred to as C1) present at the C-terminus of all CIC proteins.
Analysis of CSN1b mutant phenotypes revealed a requirement for the COP9 signalosome to prevent ectopic expression of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) target genes. It does so by protecting Capicua, a transcriptional repressor of EGFR target genes, from EGFR pathway-dependent ubiquitylation.
Cic regulated spatially restricted expression of Toll/IL-1 signaling targets in Drosophila embryogenesis.

CENP-E appears to be required to destabilize kinetochore attachment. Activation of the mechanism that corrects inappropriate kinetochore attachment requires the antagonistic effects of BubR1 and CENP-E.
Depletion of CENP-E or Nsl1-the latter mediating kinetochore targeting of Bub3-in epithelial tissues unable to activate the apoptotic program induces significant levels of aneuploidy and drives tumor-like growth.
kinetochores movement depends on SPC105R, can occur in the absence of NDC80, and is antagonized by plus-end directed forces from the CENP-E motor.
This gene is a novel member of the trithorax-group of homeotic gene activators.

Pins forms a "closed" state via intramolecular GoLoco-tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) interactions, which regulate Mud binding
Results identify Drosophila Pins as a target of Galpha(o)-mediated GPCR receptor signaling, where Galpha(o) acts downstream from Frizzled and redundantly with Galpha(i) to control the asymmetry of cell divisions.
Study identified a previously unrecognized evolutionarily conserved Pins domain (Pins(LINKER)) that requires Aurora-A phosphorylation to recruit Dlg and promote partial spindle orientation.
The Canoe-Pins(TPR) interaction recruits Canoe to the cell cortex and is required for activation of the Pins(TPR)-Mud (nuclear mitotic apparatus in mammals) spindle orientation pathway
Insc-Pins complex requires Galphai for partial activity and that the complex specifically recruits Dlg but not Mud.
The sterical hindrance requiring such a rotation probably contributes to the guanine nucleotide exchange inhibitor activity of GoLoco1 and Pins as a whole.
Prefoldin acts synergistically with Pins to regulate asymmetric division of both neuroblasts and Intermediate Neural Progenitors.
Pins is not required in the wing disc because there are parallel mechanisms for Mud localization and hence spindle orientation, making it a more robust system than in other epithelia.

Results show that mildly increasing systemic Rheb-TOR-S6K signaling sensitizes the whole organism to oxidative stress and promotes senescence of locomotor activity with age.
Our studies identify TCTP as a direct regulator of Rheb and a potential therapeutic target for tuberous sclerosis disease.
Rheb-TOR signaling controls S2 cell growth by promoting ribosome production and protein synthesis, not by direct effects on the import of amino acids or glucose.

role desat1 gene in the control of Drosophila melanogaster pheromone biosynthesis
A mutation in desat1, which codes for a desaturase, has major effects on double-bond formation in sex-specific pheromones.
A single genomic transposon inserted in the desatl gene simultaneously affected the emission and the perception of sex-specific signals, and greatly decreased the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons on the cuticle of mature flies of both sexes.
desat1 plays major role in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in drosophila and is also involved in affecting the availability of saturated fatty acids
Data suggest that Desat1 exerts its role in autophagy by controlling lipid biosynthesis and/or signaling necessary for autophagic responses.
Data suggest that the pleiotropic action of desat1 on pheromonal communication depends on the fine regulation of its transcriptional activity.
Distinct desat1 putative regulatory regions independently drive the expression in nonneural and in neural cells.
Fat desaturase Desat1 is necessary for dMyc induced systemic growth.
In Drosophila, rk function is required for the normal maturation of the fly's cuticular hydrocarbon (CH) profile, with flies mutant for rk function showing dramatically elevated levels of CHs. This effect is mostly abrogated by mutations in the Delta9 desaturase encoded by the desaturase1 gene, suggesting that desaturase1 acts downstream of rk.
we designated the sequential prolines at the second and third positions of DESAT1 as a "di-proline motif," which plays a crucial role in the regulation of Delta9-desaturase expression in response to changes in the level of cellular unsaturated fatty acids
our data suggest that the regulation of this dsat1 has evolved to allow the optimal reproduction and a successful adaptation to varied environments

Gr64f is required in combination with Gr5a for the behavioral response to trehalose and for production of nerve responses to trehalose.
While physiological imaging reveals that both populations are responsive to fatty acids (FAs), IR56d/Gr64f neurons are activated by medium-chain FAs and are sufficient for reflexive feeding response to FAs. Moreover, flies can discriminate between sugar and FAs in an aversive taste memory assay, indicating that FA taste is a unique modality in Drosophila.
Gr5a and Gr64a are each capable of functioning independently of each other within individual sugar neurons and that they are the primary receptors used in the labellum to detect sugars.(Gr64a protein, Drosophila)
The results of this study showed that the starvation-induced functional change in the taste sensory system and expression of a sugar taste receptor expression.

plays an important role in regulation of germ cell migration, polarity , cell adhesion, and cadherin binding. (review)
The scattershot allele results in an in-frame deletion of 8 amino acids at the junction of the third transmembrane domain and the second intracellular loop of Tre1 that dramatically impairs the function of this GPCR in germ cell migration.
role of the arginine of the NRY motif in Tre1 was investigated; results suggest that a salt bridge may form between this critical arginine and an aspartic acid in transmembrane alpha-helix (TM6)in Tre1
feminizing the Tre1-expressing neurons in male flies leads to rapid courtship initiation, a phenotype that leads to increased reproductive success; Tre1 is expressed in a sexually dimorphic pattern in olfactory sensory neurons and the central nervous system
Bifurcation of the Tre1 G protein-coupled receptor signaling response via G protein-dependent and independent branches enables distinct spatiotemporal regulation of germ cell migration.
The authors uncovered a novel role for Rho-like signaling through the G protein-coupled receptor Tre1, a gene previously implicated in the trans-epithelial migration of germ cells.

PARP-e autoregulates Parp transcription
propose that chromosomal PARP molecules become activated by developmental or environmental cues and strip nearby chromatin proteins off DNA to generate a puff
PARP1 is required for protein targeting to Cajal body.
demonstrate that this alteration specifically excludes PARP1 protein from heterochromatin and makes PARP1 unable to maintain repression of retrotransposable elements.
inhibits transcription by contributing to the condensation of chromatin, which creates a barrier against gene transcription
PARP1 is targeted to chromatin by association with the histone H2A variant (H2Av).
PARP is associated with the 5' end of Hsp70, and its enzymatic activity is rapidly induced by heat shock leading to nucleosome loss.
Activation of PARP-1 overexpression in the imago results in extension of the lifespan in females and males. The lifespan increase in females with PARP-1 conditional overexpression was accompanied by decrease of fertility.
Based on these findings, we propose a model that explains how PARP1 activity impacts nucleolar functions and, consequently, ribosomal biogenesis
chromatin loosening and associated initiation of gene expression is activated by phosphorylation of H2Av in a nucleosome positioned in promoter regions of PARP-1-dependent genes
A mutation of Parp also increases NAD+ levels; although, this was only observed in parkin mutant flies and not in the heterozygous Parp mutants, possibly owing to an increased PARP activity in the parkin mutants.
The results demonstrate that PARylation process in Drosophila is tightly regulated in the context of strands-breaks repair; PARP is essential during the maintenance of DNA integrity, but dispensable in the DNA repair process.
PARP1 is a versatile factor in the regulation of mRNA stability and decay.
The long-term chromatin loosening required to sustain transcription takes place when the C-terminal domain of PARP-1 binds to chromatin by interacting with histone H4 in the nucleosome.

PIWI subfamily member AGO3 had Slicer activity in vitro; data support model in which formation of a 5' terminus within rasiRNA precursors is guided by rasiRNAs originating from transcripts of the other strand in concert with Slicer activity of PIWI
Study examined piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and found that Piwi and Aubergine bind predominantly RNAs antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs.
The Drosophila homologue of protein methyltransferase 5 (dPRMT5, csul/dart5)methylates arginine in Drosophila Piwi, Ago3 and Aub proteins in vivo. Arginine methylation of Piwi proteins is required for Ago3 and Aub stability.
Ago3 acts to amplify piRNA pools and to enforce on them an antisense bias, increasing the number of piRNAs that can act to silence transposons
Studies show that Drosophila melanogaster has three PIWI proteins: PIWI, AUBERGINE (AUB), and ARGONAUTE3 (AGO3) and it has been shown that Drosophila PIWI is mostly a nuclear protein [10] and is involved in the asymmetric division of germline stem cells.

Although Argonaute3 slicing is required to efficiently trigger phased piRNA production, an alternative, slicing-independent pathway suffices to generate Piwi-bound piRNAs that repress transcription of a subset of transposon families.
We find there are large differences in evolutionary rates and gene turnover between pathways, and that paralogs of Ago2, Ago3, and Piwi/Aub show contrasting rates of evolution after duplication.
The lack of Spn-E caused a significant drop of protein levels of key ping-pong participants, Aubergine (Aub) and AGO3 proteins of PIWI subfamily, in the germline of both males and females, but did not disrupt of their assembly in nuage granules.
Data show that Cbp80 knockdown not only led to the upregulation of transposons, but also to delocalization of Piwi, Aub and Ago3, key factors in the piRNA biosynthesis pathway.
We propose that Armi shuttles between nuage and mitochondria, feeding precursor piRNAs generated by Ago3 cleavage into the Zucchini-dependent production of Aubergine- and Piwi-bound piRNAs on the mitochondrial surface.

results demonstrate the potent capability of roX genes to organize large chromatin domains in cis, on the X chromosome; found that NURF complex and MSL proteins have opposing effects on roX RNA transcription.
some molecularly severe roX1 mutations with no detectable transcript accumulation contribute dramatically to male rescue by autosomal roX1 transgenes
Data suggest that the Y chromosome is likely to act through modulation of a process that is defective in roX1 roX2 mutants: X chromosome recognition or chromatin modification by the MSL complex.
the expression of roX1 gene is instead controlled through an autoregulatory loop; the production of roX1 and msl2, two key components of the MSL complex, are coordinated to meet the dosage compensation demands of the male cell.
in clamp null females roX gene expression is activated, whereas in clamp null males roX gene expression is reduced. Therefore, CLAMP regulates roX abundance in a sex-specific manner.
the initial targeting of the dosage compensation lncRNA, roX1, to chromatin entry sites on the X chromosome is cell-type-specific, differing in neural stem cells and salivary glands
We have created a new mutant allele of roX2 and show that roX1 and roX2 have partly separable functions in dosage compensation. Loss of roX1 results in reduced expression of the genes on the X-chromosome, while loss of roX2 leads to male-specific lethal-independent upregulation of genes with male-biased testis-specific transcription.

identification of CP309 which can bind to calmodulin; it is is required for microtubule nucleation mediated by centrosomes and it interacts with the gamma-tubulin small complex
Data indicate that interphase centrioles are closely associated with Sas-4, Spd-2, Polo kinase, Pericentrin-like protein (Dplp), Asterless (Asl), Plk4 kinase, Centrosomin (Cnn) and gamma-tubulin.
Basal body formation in the male testes and the production of functional sperm does not rely on the PLP-CaM interaction, whereas production of functional mechanosensory neurons does.
Cnn and PLP directly interact at two defined sites to coordinate the cell cycle-dependent rearrangement and scaffolding activity of the centrosome to permit normal centrosome organization, cell division, and embryonic viability.

roX2 RNA splicing plays an important role in optimal male specific lethal (MSL) complex assembly or function.

UNR facilitates the interaction of MLE with the lncRNA roX2 during Drosophila dosage compensation.
We have created a new mutant allele of roX2 and show that roX1 and roX2 have partly separable functions in dosage compensation.

C. intestinalis voltage-sensor-containing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) displays channel-like 'gating' currents and directly translates changes in membrane potential into the turnover of phosphoinositides
Review. Ci-VSP, a recently described protein with sequence similarity to the voltage-sensing domain of a voltage-gated K+ channel & the phosphatase PTEN, is a transmembrane phosphoinositide phosphatase regulated by voltage changes across the membrane.
Ci-VSP has an activity that depletes PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and that depolarization-activated voltage sensor movement is translated into activation of phosphatase activity
The in vitro substrate specificity of Ci-VSP by measuring the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of the Ci-VSP cytoplasmic phosphatase domain, is determined.
The leftward shift of the Q-V voltage curve under prolonged depolarization was studied in the Ci-VSP by using electrophysiological and site-directed fluorescence measurements.
Study fused the voltage-sensing domain of Ci-VSP to a pair of fluorescent reporter proteins to generate a genetically encodable voltage-sensing fluorescent probe, the data presented gives insights into the voltage-sensing mechanism of Ci-VSP.
Ci-VSP plays a key role in voltage-induced signal transduction in cells of the digestive system and blood
The voltage dependence of enzyme activity was superimposable on the Q-V curve, which indicates that the enzyme activity is tightly coupled to voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement over the entire range of membrane potentials that elicit VSD movement.
This provides the first insight into the direct intervention of the linker in the voltage-sensor domain-phosphatase domain coupling process.
a unique voltage sensing mechanism in Ci-VSP
We show that four arginine-to-histidine mutants, namely R223H to R232H, mediate voltage-dependent proton translocation across the membrane; these residues transit through the hydrophobic core of Ci-VSP as a function of the membrane potential.
Ci-VSP consists of an N-terminal transmembrane voltage sensor domain and a C-terminal phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) domain, which in turn contains a phospphatase domain (PD) and a C2 domain.
Data suggest that anionic lipids (such as phosphatidylinositol phosphates) play crucial role in localization of peripheral membrane proteins (such as Ci-VSP, auxilin-1, talin-1, and PTEN [phosphatase/tensin homolog]). [review-like article]
The voltage sensor regulates Ci-VSP catalytic activity by causing conformational changes in the entire catalytic region, without changing their distance from the plasma membrane.

Data suggest that a G protein-coupled receptor kinase, perhaps GRK2 or 3, functions as a vertebrate kinase for Smoothened, promoting Hedgehog signal transduction during early development.
neither maternal nor zygotic Smo is required for PGC migration in zebrafish embryo. Cyclopamine instead acts independently of Smo to decrease motility of PGCs, in part by dysregulating cell adhesion and uncoupling cell polarization and translocation.

Of two Jak2 paralogues present in zebrafish, Jak2a but not Jak2b is involved in the intracellular transmission of the Ifn-gamma signal.
Studies demonstrate a conserved role for SOCS1 in T cell development and suggest a novel T cell-independent function in embryonic myelopoiesis mediated, at least in part, via its effects on receptors using the Jak2-Stat5 pathway.
our data indicate that Jak2a plays an important role in erythropoiesis and myeloid hematopoiesis
wnt1 and wnt10b are required to maintain threshold levels of Pax2.1 and Fgf8 at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary.
In zebrafish embryos lacking Wnt3a, Wnt1 and Wnt10b, the expression of engrailed orthologs, pax2a and fgf8 is not maintained after mid-somitogenesis
In the zebrafish, wnt1 and its neighboring paralog, wnt10b, are expressed in largely overlapping patterns, suggesting co-regulation; results suggest that the control of wnt1 and wnt10b expression is under complex regulation involving the interaction of multiple enhancers.
The authors results showed that Wnt10b participates in regulating fatty acid synthesis via beta-catenin, C/EBPalpha (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha) and PPARgamma (peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma) in the muscle of zebrafish.

Otp1 transcription factor is important for regulation of diencephalon development and early neuronal progenitors.
Orthopedia is one of the few known transcription factors that can determine aspects of the dopaminergic phenotype and the first known factor to control the development of the diencephalospinal dopaminergic system.
Results describe the ontogeny of vasotocin-expressing cells in zebrafish, and the selective requirement for the transcriptional regulators orthopedia and single-minded 1 in the preoptic area.
These observations suggest that the requirement for otpa and otpb function during development of the larval diencephalon is partially redundant.

Transcriptional regulation of lmo2 promoter during hematopoietic and vascular development in zebrafish is elucidated.
Scl/Lmo2 complex does not appear to autoregulate, as neither gene's expression is affected by depletion of the other
a loss-of-function mutation in lmo2, a gene specifically required for hematopoiesis and vascular development, results in failure of optic fissure closure
The transcriptional factor LMO2 regulates endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, LMO2 is required for angiogenesis and tissue healing in vivo. Thus, LMO2 is a critical determinant of vascular and tissue regeneration.
NAMPT/SIRT2-mediated activation of LMO2 by deacetylation appears to be important for hematopoietic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells and blood formation in zebrafish embryos.
Pou2 is essential for endoderm formation. Embryos devoid of maternal and zygotic pou2 lack endodermal precursors.
Data show that embryos genetically depleted of both maternal and zygotic pou2 function exhibit extreme dorsoventral patterning defects and, independently, a blastoderm-specific arrest of epiboly.
Alterations of the cytoskeleton in all three embryonic lineages contribute to the epiboly defects of Pou5f1/Oct4 deficient MZspg zebrafish embryos.
These data provide a scheme wherein pou2/pou5f1 expression in zebrafish embryos is regulated by both an autoregulatory loop and repression by RA emanating from the posterior mesoderm.
The temporospatial structure of the zebrafish Pou5f1 target networks may explain aspects of the evolution of the mammalian stem cell networks.
show that Pou5f1 binds to phylogenetically conserved Oct/Pou5f1 sites in the vox promoter, both in vivo and in vitro
Pou2 functions in multiple aspects of vertebrate development, especially in the binary decision of the mesendoderm to mesoderm and endoderm in different ways depending on the developmental stage.
The defects due to HEP induction were rescued by introducing wild-type pou2 mRNA before the heat treatments.
Vox plays a key role downstream of BMP signals in regulating the capacity of Nodal to induce endoderm versus mesoderm by modulating the activity of the Casanova/Pou2 regulatory system.
thses data position Pou5f1 and SOX-POU sites at the center of the zygotic gene activation network of vertebrates and provide a link between zygotic gene activation and pluripotency control.
maternal Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression
The posttranslational modification by phosphorylation opens the possibility that Pou5f1 may be subject to temporal or region specific modulation of its activity or stability by embryonic signaling mechanisms.
discuss mechanistic implications of simultaneous activation of transcriptional targets by ubiquitous, like Pou5f1, and region-specific inducers, emerging as a common regulatory motif in early development
Regulation of mych by Pou5f1 appears to be direct transcriptional activation.

Data suggest that, in developing gastrula, Znfl1 controls developmental gene expression of Hoxb1b in embryonic posterior neuroectoderm by acting upstream of Pou5f3 and Sall4; these proteins appear to be involved in neurogenesis. (Znfl1 = zinc finger-like gene 1; Hoxb1b = homeobox B1b protein; Pou5f3 = POU domain class 5 transcription factor 3; Sall4 = spalt-like transcription factor 4)
Western blot analysis were conducted on developing hatchlings with Oct4 antibody and at 13.6 and 21.6mugL(-1)dose,it showed over expression elucidating stimulatory role of nanosilver.  In silico analysis depicted a firm interaction of nanosilver with Oct4 revealing their key role in growth stimulation of developing embryos.
Pou5f3 remodels chromatin on high nucleosome affinity regions at zygotic genome activation.
During gastrulation, the expression of the Oct4-related PouV gene pou5f3 (also called pou2), which is widely observed at earlier stages, was rapidly localized to an array of isolated spotted domains, each of which coincided with individual proneural clusters. These results suggest that pou5f3 promotes early neurogenesis in proneural clusters, but negatively regulates later neurogenesis.
Results found that Oct4 is rapidly induced during zebrafish retina regeneration. It mediates a gene regulatory network during Muller glia (MG) reprogramming. The tudy reveals unique mechanistic involvement of Oct4, during MG reprogramming and cell cycle exit in zebrafish, which may also account for the inefficient retina regeneration in mammals.
We find that pouC is a multi-functional transcriptional regulator containing separable activation, repression, protein-protein interaction, and DNA binding domains. Using zebrafish heart development as a model system, we demonstrate that pouC knockdown impairs cardiac morphogenesis and affects cardiovascular function. We also find that levels of pouC expression must be fine-tuned to enable proper heart formation.
eve1 expression in the pharyngeal region is correlated with two key steps of tooth development: initiation and morphogenesis of the first tooth, and ameloblast differentiation of all developing teeth
eve1 is crucial for the organization of the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axis in the gastrula ectoderm and also has trunk- and tail-promoting activity.
find that Eve1 functions as a transcriptional repressor and is required for normal mesodermal progenitor cell development
Hoxb1a target Prickle1b functions cell-autonomously to control facial neuron migration, a single aspect of r4 identity.
Hoxb1b is likely to directly regulate ppp1r14al expression in rhombomere 4.
Data indicate that hox genes hoxb1a and hoxb1b have separate functions in hindbrain development.
the similarity of hoxb3a/Hoxa3 regulatory mechanisms reflect the shared descent of both genes from a single ancestral paralog, expression of both genes in the posterior hindbrain and spinal cord in embryo

Hoxb1b regulates mitotic spindle rotation during the oriented neural keel symmetric mitoses that are required for normal neural tube lumen formation in the zebrafish.
Data indicate that hox genes hoxb1a and hoxb1b have separate functions in hindbrain development.
Data suggest that, in developing gastrula, Znfl1 controls developmental gene expression of Hoxb1b in embryonic posterior neuroectoderm by acting upstream of Pou5f3 and Sall4; these proteins appear to be involved in neurogenesis. (Znfl1 = zinc finger-like gene 1; Hoxb1b = homeobox B1b protein; Pou5f3 = POU domain class 5 transcription factor 3; Sall4 = spalt-like transcription factor 4)
Loss of hoxb1b together with pbx4 reverts the hindbrain to a groundstate identity, demonstrating the importance of hox genes in patterning nearly the entire hindbrain, and a key requirement for Pbx in this process. Additionally, we provide evidence that while pbx genes regulate RA signaling, hoxb1b regulates hindbrain identity through complex regulation of FGF signaling
Although oncogenic NRAS expression alone was found to be insufficient to promote tumor formation, loss of functional p53 was found to collaborate with NRAS expression in the genesis of melanoma.
cyp26 has an important role in linking the Fgf, Wnt and RA signals to regulate AP patterning of the neural ectoderm in the late blastula to gastrula embryo in zebrafish
The metabolites of all-trans RA produced by Cyp26D1 were the same as that produced by Cyp26A1, which are mainly 4-hydroxy-all-trans-RA and 4-oxo-all-trans-RA.
Expression of Cyp26a1 is under complex feedback and feedforward control by retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor signaling.
2.5 k fragment underlies the regulation of the zebrafish cyp26a1 gene by retinoic acid
Cyp26 enzymes function in endoderm to regulate pancreatic field size
Zebrafish cyp26a1 promoter contains a novel retinoic acid response element that plays crucial roles in regulating its expression during early development.
Retinoic acid (RA)-responsive genes are differentially sensitive to alterations in the RA pathway and, in particular, cyp26a1 and raraa are under a high pressure to maintain signaling integrity.
In zebrafish, two Cyp26 enzymes, Cyp26a1 and Cyp26c1, are expressed in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) and predominantly overlap with vascular progenitors (VPs).
Cyp26a1 expression can shape a retinoic acid gradient.
Data support a model in which retinoic acid (RA) on the dorsal side of the embryo induces anterior kidney fates while posterior kidney progenitors are protected ventrally by the RA-catabolizing enzyme Cyp26a1.
In the analyzed samples we found two novel TH mRNAs, one lacking exon 8, and another lacking exons 8+9. These new splicing variants are described in a region of TH previously reported to be conserved.
The developmental sequence of THir cell groups in dogfish appears to be rather similar to that described for teleosts, apart from the appearance of the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and pallial cells, which lack in teleosts.
th1 is predominant in the brain of zebrafish and th2 in the periphery.
mRNA expression of TH1 and TH2 is differentially affected by hypoxia exposure in larvae and adults.  TH1 mRNA levels are much higher in eye and brain

The differential expression of the aromatase genes, particularly CYP19A2 in the brain, suggests that the two aromatase genes play different roles in the reproductive behavior and/or physiology of bony fish.
zebrafish Anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh) is regulated by sox9a, sox9b, and cyp19a1a during gonad development
These results demonstrate seasonal and sex differences in brain aromatase mRNA expression in a teleost fish and suggest a role for aromatase in the expression of vocal-acoustic and alternative male reproductive phenotypes.
These analyses suggest that variants of CYP19 are not associated with risk of breast cancer.
amh is a candidate gene down-regulating cyp19a1a, leading to "juvenile ovary-to-testis" transformation.
Data indicate taht monocrotophos (MCP) exposure modulated gene expression of forkhead transcription factor gene L2 (foxl2), doublesex/mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (dmrt1), gonadal aromatase (cyp19a1a) and brain aromatase (cyp19a1b).
Data show that cytochrome P450 enzymes Cyp17-I, Cyp11c1, Cyp19a1a and Cyp19a1b and one of their regulators forkhead protein Foxl2a were detected both in the testis and ovary.
The results from the present study strongly suggest that DNA methylation is one of mechanisms that is involved in the regulation of cyp19a1a gene expression during folliculogenesis
Mutant zebrafish lines lacking the ovarian aromatase gene (cyp19a1a) leads to all-male offspring, suggesting that aromatase plays a critical role in directing ovarian differentiation and development.
Knocking down the expression of gdf9 and cyp19a1a with vivo-morpholinos caused a male-skewed sex ratio.
Dual functions of the cyp19a1a gene during sex differentiation: cyp19a1a is not only indispensable for female sex differentiation but also required for male sex differentiation.
cyp19a1a is expressed early during development, before the histological differentiation of the gonads, and the down-regulation of cyp19a1a expression is likely responsible for the testicular differentiation.
The whole-body androgen levels, follicle-stimulating hormone beta and luteinizing hormone beta protein levels in the pituitary, and transcript levels of genes known to be involved in spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in the testes were significantly higher in the cyp19a1a mutant and aromatase double-mutant males than in the wild-type and cyp19a1b mutant male.
there is an interaction between cyp19a1a and dmrt1 in zebrafish gonadal differentiation; estrogens are dispensable in controlling early folliculogenesis

the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump has a role in expression of no tail (ntl) and left-right dynein related (lrdr) in the dorsal forerunner cells during gastrulation
Regulation of canonical Wnt signaling by ntl is essential for posterior mesoderm formation.
Ntl regulates a downstream network of other transcription factors and identify an in vivo Ntl binding site that resembles the consensus T-box binding site (TBS) previously identified by in vitro studies.
Data demonstrate that the nodal-independent regulation of ntl is essential for tail formation in zebrafish.
embryonic mesodermal progenitors uniquely establish their own niche--with Brachyury being essential for creating a domain of high Wnt and low RA signaling--rather than having a niche created by separate support cells.
As a proof of principle, it has dynamically profiled No tail a (Ntla)-dependent genes at different stages of axial mesoderm development in zebrafish, discovering discrete sets of transcripts.
observed normal cardiac convergence in spt(-/-) and ntl(-/-) embryos implying that these novel roles of spt and ntl in PGP migration cannot be explained simply by generalised effects on midline convergence
Ntla and Spt do not differentially regulate medial floor plate (MPF) induction along the anterior-posterior axis; rather, the T-box genes act redundantly within margin derived cells to promote the posterior extension of MFP progenitors.

Dbx1b marks the progenitor populations that give rise to the dorsal habenulae. In addition, the expression of dbx1b in the dorsal diencephalon is tightly controlled by FGF signaling.
nr2f1a plays a critical role for vascular development in zebrafish.
Nr2f1a concomitantly coordinates atrial and atrial-atrioventricular canal size through both Bmp-dependent and independent mechanisms.
Using nr2f1a and nr2f2 mutants, we find that Nr2f1a and Nr2f2 have redundant requirements restricting ventricular cardiomyocyte number and promoting development of the posterior pharyngeal muscles.
Oculomotor circuits in hindbrain rhombomeres 5-6 develop and function independently of hox3 genes.

Data show a novel interaction between zebrafish Nanos and myosin light chain II (Mylz2).
Since we know so little about the molecules regulating vertebrate myocyte fusion, we propose that the mylpfa:H2B-GFP transgene will be a very useful reporter for conducting forward and reverse genetic screens to identify new components regulating vertebrate myocyte fusion.
Spatial and temporal regulation of this gene suggests specific functions for the enzyme during oogenesis and early development of zebrafish.
These results suggest that Dnmt1 activity helps direct histone methylation by Suv39h1 and that, together, Dnmt1 and Suv39h1 help guide the terminal differentiation of particular tissues.
Data show that in dnmt1 homozygous mutants, reactivation of gfp expression occurs in a reproducible subset of cells, raising the possibility of different sensitivities or alternative silencing mechanisms in discrete cell populations.
Thus, our data suggest that Dnmt1 is dispensable for pancreatic duct or endocrine cell formation, but not for acinar cell survival. In addition, Dnmt1 may influence the differentiation of pancreatic beta cell progenitors.
These data provide the first evidence that Uhrf1 and Dnmt1 function is required for vertebrate lens development and maintenance.

These results show that survival motor neuron functions in motor axon development and suggest that these early developmental defects may lead to subsequent motoneuron loss.
Survival motor neuron has a novel function in motor neurons independent of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biosynthesis.
Reduction of Gemin2, unlike reduction of SMN, in zebrafish embryos does not directly cause motor axon outgrowth defects.
Since Gemin2 and SMN both function in snRNP biogenesis yet only SMN knockdown causes motor axon defects, these data are consistent with an additional role for SMN that is snRNP independent.
Smn mutants in zebrafish survive to larval stages and exhibit presynaptic neuromuscular junction defects.
SMN is needed early in development of motoneuron dendrites and axons to develop normally and that this is essential for proper connectivity and movement.

we established that the additional supply of Smn protein in motoneurons is necessary for proper axonogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner
our finding that elevation of Pgk1 levels or activity, via injection of Pgk1 mRNA or treatment with terazosin respectively, robustly ameliorated MN pathology in smn morphant zebrafish provides an initial demonstration that these pathways are amenable to therapeutic intervention.
In motor neurons, smn1 interacts with the RNA binding protein, HuD and regulates motoneuron development and function.

Expression profiles of zebrafish brd2 paralogs support a role in vertebrate developmental patterning and morphogenesis
brd2a on chromosome 19 exhibits both maternal and zygotic contributions to early development and patterning, analogous to the brd2 ortholog in Drosophila.
these results suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for Brd2 in the proper formation and/or patterning of segmented tissues, including the vertebrate CNS, where it acts as a bi-modal regulator of apoptosis, and is necessary, directly or indirectly, for proper expression of genes that pattern the MHB and/or regulate differentiation in the anterior hindbrain.

Data suggest that Clock1a coordinates mesoderm development and primitive hematopoiesis in embryos by up-regulating Nodal-Smad3 signaling; Clock1a alterations produce embryonic defects with shortened body length, lack of ventral tail fin, or partial defect of the eyes; Clock1a activates Smad3a promoter via its E-box1 element. (Clock1a = clock circadian regulator a; Nodal = nodal modulator 1; Smad3a = SMAD family member 3a)
A novel regulatory base sequence functions as a key element to drive the somite-specificity of myf-5.
Functional analysis of intron 1 showed a strong, negative, cis-regulatory element located at +502/+835, and this is the first study to identify a novel, cis-acting silencer that is crucial to negatively regulating myf-5 expression.

Myf5 and Myod function independently during cranial myogenesis.
cell lineage-specific expression of myf5 is delicately orchestrated by multiple modules within the distal upstream region. This study provides an insight to understand the molecular control of myf5 and myogenesis in the zebrafish.
a novel intronic microRNA, miR-In300, which is derived from I300 of the first intron of zebrafish myf5, enables significant repression of myf5 promoter activity through silencing the long isoform of the Dickkopfs-3 gene.
the secreted ligand Dkk3a binds to the membrane receptor Itgalpha6b, which increases the protein level of phosphorylated p38a and activates myf5 promoter activity of zebrafish embryos during myogenesis.
Loss of Myf5 function results in a cascade effect that begins with abnormal formation of the dorsal organizer during gastrulation, causing defects in myf5-knockdown embryos

These results suggest an involvement of the BDNF/TrkB system in the regulation of food intake and energy balance in zebrafish, as in mammals
One of the modulators of TOR is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which activates the TOR signaling pathway to promote protein synthesis, synapse strengthening, and the creation of new neural networks.findings demonstrate that TOR activation in old animals occurs in the early phase of consolidation, and follows a pattern identical to that of BDNF expression.
BDNF is involved in the gonadal function of adult zebrafish, and mainly in the adult ovary.

isolation and characterization by spatiotemporal expression detected in the developing zebrafish
Zebrafish embryos lacking Rad21, or cohesin subunit Smc3, fail to express runx3 and lose hematopoietic runx1 expression in early embryonic development.
in zebrafish adult HSCs can be formed without an intact runx1.
hematopoietic stem cell numbers depended on activity of the transcription factor Runx1, on blood flow, and on proper development of the dorsal aorta
Runx1 is induced by high Pu.1 level and in turn transrepresses pu.1 expression, thus constituting a negative feedback loop that fashions a favorable Pu.1 level required for balanced fate commitment to neutrophils versus macrophages.
Morpholino knockdown of Myef2 or Runx1 in zebrafish results in reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that these two factors also interact in vivo to regulate hematopoiesis.
We propose that cohesin and CTCF have distinct functions in the regulation of runx1 during zebrafish embryogenesis.

her7 plays a role in coordinating the oscillations of neighboring cells in the presomitic mesoderm
Data show that although these genes have partially redundant functions in most of the zebrafish trunk region, her1 is necessary for proper formation of the anteriormost somites and her7 is necessary for proper formation of somites posterior to somite 11.
Data show that her7 is required for initiating the expression in the posterior presomitic mesoderm (PSM), while her1 is required to propagate the cyclic expression in the intermediate and anterior PSM.
her1 and her7, coding for inhibitory gene regulatory proteins, are implicated in genesis of the somitogenesis oscillator.
Data show that deltaC is required for coherence of wavelike expression domains of cyclic genes her1 and her7 and maintenance of their expression levels, as well as for cyclic transcription of deltaC itself.
Over-expression of her12, her15 or her7 disrupts cyclic gene expression and somite border formation, and structure function analysis of Her7 indicates that DNA binding, but not Groucho-recruitment seems to be important in this process.
Oscillations of the somite segmentation clock may be generated by a delayed negative feedback loop in which the products of two Notch target genes, her1 and her7, directly inhibit their own transcription.
Data define a network of Her/Hes dimers underlying transcriptional negative feedback within the zebrafish segmentation clock, where Her7 acts directly within the delayed negative feedback as a DNA-binding heterodimer with Hes6.
the comparison between single her1hu2124 and her7hu2526 mutants and her1hu2124/bea tm98 double mutants suggests independent roles for both her genes in regulation of distinct phases of the segmentation clock.
loss of her1 or her7 can allow oscillations to continue with unchanged period but with reduced amplitude and impaired synchrony
Autoregulatory negative-feedback loops of the repressor Her7 dimers can generate synchronized gene expression oscillations in wild-type embryos and reproduce the dynamics of the segmentation oscillator in different mutant conditions.
Studied source of noise in Zebrafish somite clock counteracted by Notch signalling; found clock desynch'n, in absence of Notch signalling, is due to stochastic dissociation of Her1/7 repressor proteins from oscillating her1/7 autorepressed target genes.
Pairing of segmentation clock genes drives robust pattern formation.

hand2 can drive cardiomyocyte production in multiple contexts and through multiple mechanisms
hand2 and the co-expressed zinc-finger transcription factor osr1 have functionally antagonistic influences on kidney development.

In zebrafish embryos lacking Wnt3a, Wnt1 and Wnt10b, the expression of engrailed orthologs, pax2a and fgf8 is not maintained after mid-somitogenesis
data suggest a specific role for Wnt3a in the development of cardiac NCCs; propose that this function of wnt3a in r6 is partially mediated by crip2 expression in the premigratory cardiac NCCs, which subsequently affects cardiac function and PA patterning
It was shown that Wnt3a-Wnt8a/beta-catenin signaling directly regulates ciliogenic transcription factor foxj1a expression and ciliogenesis in zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle.
Data suggest that Wnt3, Wnt3a, and Wnt8a bind to their respective receptors (Fz8, Lrp6, and Lypd6) in ordered plasma membrane environments; ordered plasma membrane environments appear to be essential for binding of Wnt proteins to their receptor complexes and stimulation of downstream signaling activity.
We identify TRAF6 as an important component in Wnt3a signaling to promote activation of Wnt target genes, a finding important for understanding mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression.

Downregulation of EphA4a compromises actomyosin cables and cells with different rhombomeric identity intermingle, and the phenotype is rescued enhancing myosin II activity.
In myelinating co-cultures and in zebrafish, we find that the number of mature oligodendrocytes does not change as result of manipulating signaling through the ephrinA1-EphA4 system. However, in both systems, inhibition of EphA4 signaling leads to a higher number of myelin sheaths formed by each oligodendrocyte. In isolated oligodendrocyte cultures, activation of EphA4 reduced process extension.
The authors show that forward signaling of EphA4 is required for border sharpening and induction of boundary cells in the zebrafish hindbrain, which they find both require kinase-dependent signaling, with a lesser input of PDZ domain-dependent signaling.

Zebrafish gene (zfARNT2) is not essential for mediating TCDD developmental toxicity in zebrafish.
The only effect in arnt2(-/-) larvae that occurred before 120 hours postfertilization (hpf) was a decrease in expression of sim1, an Arnt2 dimerization partner, in the hypothalamus and ventral thalamus at 72 hpf.
Arnt2 contributes to control of lateral positioning of longitudinal hypothalamic-spinal axons by negative regulation of robo3a.1 expression, which in turn attenuates the repulsive activity of Robo2.
Eomes plays a role in specifying the embryonic organizer.
regulates the expression of a zygotic homeobox transcription factor mtx2
Results suggest that eomesodermin promotes endoderm induction in marginal blastomeres by facilitating the assembly of a transcriptional activating complex on the casanova promoter.
These results suggest that both Eomes genes are involved in the zebrafish immune response, particularly in lymphocyte function as has been found in mammals.
Eomes is a Nodal-transducing factor that acts, directly and indirectly, in concert with FoxH1 to carry out all Nodal-dependent processes during early mesendoderm specification.
Eomesa has a strictly maternal role in the initiation of epiboly, and is required for normal expression of the endoderm markers sox32, bon and og9x; however it is not essential for endoderm formation.
Smad2 and Eomesodermin a (Eomesa) bind common genomic regions proximal to genes involved in mesoderm and endoderm formation, suggesting Eomesa forms a general component of the Smad2 signalling complex in zebrafish.

Klf2a is an important regulator of endocardial cell morphology.
reveals a beta1 integrin-Klf2-Egfl7-signaling pathway that is tightly regulated by cerebral cavernous malformation proteins
Oscillatory flow modulates mechanosensitive klf2a expression through trpv4 and trpp2 during heart valve development.
The klf2ash317 mutation produces a truncated Klf2a protein but, unlike morpholino induced klf2a knockdown, does not affect cardiovascular development.
Heart valves originate from progenitors located in the ventricle and atrium that generate the valve leaflets through a coordinated set of endocardial tissue movements, dependent on the expression of fibronectin1b. Blood flow and klf2a control these cell behaviours and fibronectin1b synthesis.
In turn, Heg1 stabilizes levels of Krit1 protein, and both Heg1 and Krit1 dampen expression levels of klf2a, a major mechanosensitive gene. The correct balance of blood-flow-dependent induction and Krit1 protein-mediated repression of klf2a and notch1b ultimately shapes cardiac valve leaflet morphology.

the chaperon Wls and its ligands Wnt9a and Wnt5b are expressed in the ectoderm, whereas juxtaposed chondrocytes express Frzb and Gpc4.
A mutation in glypican4 leads to severe lateral line primordium migration defects. Glypican4 regulates the feedback loop between Wnt/beta-catenin/Fgf signaling in the primordium redundantly with other HSPGs. A mutation in glypican4 affects primordium migration non cell-autonomously
disruption of wls resulted in a significant loss of craniofacial bone, whereas lack of gpc4, wnt5b and wnt9a resulted in severely delayed endochondral ossification.
The results suggest that Gpc4 is crucial for generating the environment required for efficient migration of endodermal cells, uncovering a novel function of Gpc4 during development.

Here we report the isolation, mapping, chromosomal synteny and spatiotemporal expression of gbx1 and gbx2 in zebrafish. We focus in particular on the expression of these genes during development of the midbrain-hindbrain territory.
Ectopic expression of gbx2 by mRNA injection caused cyclopia or truncation of the fore- and midbrain and severely affected isthmic and cerebellar structures.
gbx2 expression during the somitogenesis stage in zebrafish is regulated by a complex mechanism involving Pax2 as well as activators and suppressors in the regions flanking the gene.
gbx2/Gbx2 has an evolutionarily conserved role in anterior hindbrain development.
Gbx2 functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate the specification and morphogenesis of the mid-hindbrain junction in a dosage- and stage-dependent manner.
in the zebrafish gbx1 and gbx2 are required redundantly for morphogenesis of the cerebellar primordium and subsequent cerebellar differentiation, but that this requirement is alleviated by knocking down Otx

Expression of constitutively active and dominant-negative isoforms of RHOA revealed that it acts downstream of VANGL2.
Mutation of the canonical planar-cell-polarity gene vangl2, which decouples the asymmetric phenotypes of sibling hair-cell pairs, results in randomly positioned, randomly oriented sibling cells that nonetheless retain specific wiring.

Study shows that the bucky ball gene in the zebrafish is required to assemble the Balbiani body; in the absence of bucky ball the Balbiani body fails to form, and vegetal mRNAs are not localized in oocytes.[bucky ball]
These results identify Bucky ball (buc) as the first gene necessary and sufficient for germ plasm organization in vertebrates.
