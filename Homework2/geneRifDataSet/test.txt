Ptf1 function is inhibited by notch
We propose that low levels of Ptf1a promote endocrine fate, whereas high levels repress endocrine fate and promote exocrine fate.
Exocrine differentiation and proliferation factor (exdpf) is a direct target gene of pancreas-specific transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a).
The timing of Ptf1a expression suggests that it is involved in the very early stages or steps in the differentiation of amacrine cells, which can be seen to rapidly diversify into a large number of subtypes.
Postembryonic antagonism of Ptf1a, a master regulator of pancreatic development and acinar cell fate specification, induced expression of endocrine genes including insulin in the exocrine compartment. Induced insulin+ cells are derived from acinar cells.
Autoregulation of ptf1a is absolutely required for exocrine pancreas formation.
In ptf1a haploinsufficiency, more ptf1a-lineage-labeled cells are traced into the pancreatic Notch-responsive cell and endocrine compartments. More reduction of ptf1a gene dosage converts pancreatic progenitor cells to non-pancreatic cell fates.
Results highlight the possibility that Ptf1a may act as an important transcription factor for enteric neuron development.

Over-expression of her12, her15 or her7 disrupts cyclic gene expression and somite border formation, and structure function analysis of Her7 indicates that DNA binding, but not Groucho-recruitment seems to be important in this process.
The authors concluded that, independently from variations in foxj1a mRNA levels, all cilia seem to acquire a motile ultrastructure. However, Notch signalling modulates the final number of functionally moving cilia early in the Kupffer's Vesicle precursors, via a mechanism that involves the activity of Her12, a transcription repressor so far only involved in somitogenesis.

there is an interaction between cyp19a1a and dmrt1 in zebrafish gonadal differentiation; estrogens are dispensable in controlling early folliculogenesis
The degenerative phenotype resulting from a null mutation in the zebrafish gene indicates that hair cells and retinal cells require Rab escort protein 1 for survival.

The development of lymphatic vessels in zebrafish embyros depends on Vegfc signaling.
vegfc signalling is suppressed by Dll4 in developing zebrafish intersegmental arteries.
Rspo1-Wnt-VegfC-Vegfr3 signaling plays a crucial role as an endothelial-autonomous permissive cue for developmental angiogenesis.
Vegfc acts in two distinct modes during development: as a paracrine factor secreted from arteries to guide closely associated lymphatic vasculature and as an autocrine factor to drive migratory persistence during angiogenesis.
The parallel growth of motoneuron axons with the dorsal aorta depends on Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling in zebrafish.
Vegfc has an essential role in lymphangiogenesis [review]
In the embryo, phenotypes driven by increased Vegfc are suppressed in the absence of Ccbe1, and Vegfc-driven sprouting is enhanced by local Ccbe1 overexpression. Moreover, Vegfc- and Vegfr3-dependent Erk signaling is impaired in the absence of Ccbe1.
Vegfc is dispensable for facial lymphatic sprouting but not for the complete development of the facial lymphatic network.

These findings thus underscore a role for posterior cardinal vein and VegfC in patterning the head kidney prior to organ assembly and function.
Vegfc acts through ERK to induce sprouting and differentiation of trunk lymphatic progenitors.
Overall, the data show that HHEX controls blood vessel and lymphatic vessel formation by regulating the VEGFC/FLT4/PROX1 signaling axis.

these results demonstrate a novel role of Par3 during neural crest migration, which is likely to be conserved in other processes that involve contact inhibition of locomotion such as cancer invasion or cell dispersion.
Pard3 mediates contact inhibition between neural crest cells and promotes timely myelin gene expression but is not essential for neural crest migration or myelination.

Cx52.6 is alternatively spliced in the retina, resulting in an additional isoform, designated as Cx53.4, which differs from the originally described Cx52.6 only by the final C-terminal peptide (12 vs. 4 aa). Further protein sequence alignments revealed that Cx53.4 represents the counterpart of alternatively spliced mouse Cx57 and human Cx62.

zebrafish Anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh) is regulated by sox9a, sox9b, and cyp19a1a during gonad development
amh is a candidate gene down-regulating cyp19a1a, leading to "juvenile ovary-to-testis" transformation.
Gdf9 significantly suppressed the expression of amh while increased that of activin beta subunits (inhbaa and inhbb) in vitro.
These data suggest that an important aspect of Fsh bioactivity in stimulating spermatogenesis is implemented by restricting the different inhibitory effects of Amh and by counterbalancing them with stimulatory signals, such as Igf3.
amh controls the balance between proliferation and differentiation of male germ cells.
These results show that ancestral Amh functions included development of the gonadal soma in ovaries and testes and regulation of gamete proliferation and maturation. A major gap in our understanding is the identity of the gene encoding a zebrafish Amh receptor; we show here that the loss of amhr2 is associated with the breakpoint of a chromosome rearrangement shared among cyprinid fishes.

data indicate that zebrafish Nkd1 and Nkd2 function to limit both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling
Nkd1 knockdown in the dorsal forerunner cells causes beta-catenin nuclear localization/transcriptional activation & changes in DFC migration, Kupffer's vesicle formation, ciliogenesis, left-right patterning, & asymmetric charon expression.
Data demonstrate that Nkd1 binds to beta-catenin and prevents its nuclear accumulation. Nkd1 function is dependent on its interaction with the cell membrane.
Nkd1 functions as a passive antagonist of Wnt signaling, functioning only when homeostatic levels of Wnt signaling have been breached or when Wnt signaling becomes destabilized.
Nkd1 activity is specifically dependent on Wnt ligand activation of the receptor. Nkd1 is recruited to the Wnt signalosome with Dvl2, where it becomes activated to move into the cytoplasm to interact with beta-catenin, inhibiting its nuclear accumulation.
This work reveals that the zebrafish Nkd1 EF-hand is essential to balance Wnt signaling inputs and modulate the appropriate outputs, while the Drosophila-like EF-Hand primarily functions in beta-catenin signaling.

Isolation and expression analysis of foxj1 in zebrafish embryos are reported.
Study shows that the cilia that underlie left-right patterning on the Xenopus gastrocoel roof plate (GRP) and zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle are severely shortened or fail to form in Foxj1 morphants.
Study shows that Foxj1a activates a constellation of genes essential for motile cilia formation and function, and that its activity is sufficient for ectopic development of cilia that resemble motile cilia.
foxj1a regulates asymmetric development through dorsal forerunner cells in a cell-autonomous fashion but foxj1b functions indirectly.
activation of a Foxj1 transcriptional network of ciliogenic genes is an evolutionarily conserved response to multiple forms of tissue damage
It was shown that Wnt3a-Wnt8a/beta-catenin signaling directly regulates ciliogenic transcription factor foxj1a expression and ciliogenesis in zebrafish Kupffer's vesicle.
all of these findings provide the first evolutionary perspective into the transcriptional control of motile ciliogenesis and allow us to propose a conserved FoxJ1-regulated mechanism for motile cilia biogenesis back to the origin of the metazoans.
Rer1p depletion reduced ciliary length and function by increasing gamma-secretase complex assembly and activity and, consequently, enhancing Notch signaling as well as reducing Foxj1a expression.
The authors concluded that, independently from variations in foxj1a mRNA levels, all cilia seem to acquire a motile ultrastructure. However, Notch signalling modulates the final number of functionally moving cilia early in the Kupffer's Vesicle precursors, via a mechanism that involves the activity of Her12, a transcription repressor so far only involved in somitogenesis.

Ezh2 is essential to sustain tissue integrity and to set up proper maternal mRNA contribution.
ezh2-deficient mutants fail to properly regenerate their spinal cord after caudal fin transection suggesting that Ezh2 and H3K27me3 methylation might also be involved in the process of regeneration in zebrafish.
Ezh2 contributes to hematopoiesis by enhancing expression of hematopoietic genes such as cmyb and lck. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Ezh2 acts in both circadian regulation and hematopoiesis independent of silencing PRC2.
The ezh2 mRNA and Ezh2 protein were present during adulthood (70 days post-fertilization) in both wild type and ezh2(sa1199), R18STOP (stop mutation in the second exon of the ezh2 gene) mutant zebrafish. Study concludes that the ezh2(sa1199) allele does not exhibit an ezh2 loss-of-function phenotype.

mitotic entry and maintenance is not only mediated by the activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 but also by the regulation of PP2A by GW
inhibition of PP2A-B55delta results from Ensa, that is phosphorylated in mitosis by the protein kinase Greatwall; this converts Ensa into specific inhibitor of PP2A-B55delta; this pathway represents a previously unknown element in mitosis control

we showed that the Gwl nuclear localization is indispensable for the biochemical function of Gwl in promoting mitotic entry.
study provides evidence that PP1 targets the auto-phosphorylation site of Gwl, resulting in efficient Gwl inactivation; this step is necessary to facilitate subsequent complete dephosphorylation of Gwl by PP2A-B55
Full dephosphorylation of Gwl results in complete inactivation of Arpp19 and ENSA, and dephosphorylation of mitotic substrates. this feed-back loop irreversibly induces mitotic exit.
Data suggest Greatwall kinase (Gwl) associates with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), particularly PP1gamma subunit, which mediates dephosphorylation of Gwl Ser-883; consistent with mitotic activation of Gwl, its association with PP1 is disrupted in mitotic cells; subunits PPP1R3B and PPP1R13L associate with Gwl; thus, PPP1R3B appears to act as cell cycle regulator in oocytes that functions by governing Gwl dephosphorylation.

effects of polymorphisms within NAT1 coding region and 3'-UTR and associated haplotypes on catalytic activity and mRNA and protein levels; findings provide support for reported associations of 1088T>A and 1095C>A polymorphisms with birth defects
NAT1 affects cell growth and morphology
Data suggest that the 5'-UTRs of arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) are differentially regulated.
NAT1 *10 and *11 significantly increase NAT1 protein level/enzyme activity, enabling the classification of carriers into reference and rapid acetylators
We observe a signature of balancing selection maintaining variation in the 3'-UTR of NAT1, suggesting that these variants may play a functional role.
NAT1 14B-catalyzed acetylation phenotype is substrate-dependent; NAT1 14B exhibits higher N- and O-acetylation catalytic efficiency.
NAT1 is transcribed from a major promoter, NATb, and an alternative promoter, NATa, resulting in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) with distinct 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs).
meta-analysis wasn't able to detect a significant association between polymorphisms in NAT1 and predisposition to colorectal carcinoma
NAT1 is a possible prognostic biomarker for male breast cancer.
the activities of the xenobiotic metabolizing phase II enzyme N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) were higher in the late passages compared to the early passages
individuals with NAT2 genotype have an elevated risk of colorectal cancer; however, no evidence was found for association between NAT1 and 2 rapid genotype and colorectal adenoma risk
Smoking, variation in N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) and 2 (NAT2), and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
NAT1 rapid acetylation alone as well as combination of NAT1 rapid-NAT2 slow acetylation did not modulate the risk of oral precancer and cancer in an Indian patient population.
Only ADP and ATP are suitable substrates for human AAC1.
Upregulation of NAT1 is associated with estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer.
Epidemiological studies suggest that the NAT1 and NAT2 acetylation polymorphisms modify the risk of developing cancers of the urinary bladder, colorectal, breast, head and neck, and lung
Data suggest that NAT1/NAT2 participate in biotransformation of many aromatic/heterocyclic amines; molecular models have been developed regarding acetylation mechanism, active site structure, and substrate/inhibitor-binding specificity. [REVIEW]
This meta-analysis suggests that there was no association between the NAT1*10 allele and bladder cancer risk.
the present study provides evidence for the role of NAT1 and NAT2 variations in NSCLP, and indicates that interactions between the NAT1 and NAT2 genes may be important in susceptibility to NSCLP.
Complementation studies revealed that the N-terminal domain of L9 is necessary and sufficient to improve the fitness of some Der mutants, suggesting that this domain may help stabilize compromised ribosomes that accumulate when Der is defective.

Arylamine N-acetyltransferase polymorphisms in Han Chinese patients with ankylosing spondylitis and their correlation to the adverse drug reactions to sulfasalazine
We report that miR-1290 directly targets the NAT1 3'-UTR and that NAT1 protein expression is correlated with improved OS of breast cancer patients.
N-acetyltransferase polymorphisms are associated with risk of lymphoma subtypes.
NAT1 genotype affects thioguanine nucleotide levels in patients treated with thiopurines and aminosalicylates and could therefore influence the toxicity and efficacy of these drugs.
NAT1 genetic polymorphisms were found to be a risk factor for smokers in the Black population of South Africa with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
The rs1799931(G>A) genotype was detected in the control population but not in the T2DM population. The wild type (G) allele frequency was higher in T2DM than controls. The mutant allele (A) in rs1799931(G>A) had a protective effect for T2DM.
The association of colorectal adenomas with the rs6983267 variant at 8q24 was considered as 'highly credible', the 'less credible' associations were identified with a further four variants of four independent genes: MTHFR c.677C>T p.A222V(rs1801133), TP53 c.215C>G p.R72P (rs1042522), NQO1 c.559C>T p.P187S (rs1800566), and NAT1 alleles imputed as fast acetylator genotypes. [meta-analysis]
identified a novel endogenous role for human NAT1 that might explain some of its effects in cancer cell growth and survival
the results suggested that there was no association between NAT1*10 allele and bladder cancer risk (meta-analysis).
NAT1-catalyzed N-acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is higher in T cell than in other immune cell subtypes and that individual variation in N-acetylation capacity is dependent upon NATb mRNA and NAT1 haplotype.
Results indicate that haplotypes that provide rapid N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) and slow N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) acetylating phenotypes may influence the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children.
Data showed that NAT1, NAT2, and ESR1 expression were increased in primary breast tumor tissue and that NAT1 expression was much higher than NAT2. NAT1 and ESR1 expression were strongly associated, whereas NAT2 and ESR1 expression were not. Although NAT1 and NAT2 expression were associated, the magnitude was moderate.
we have observed that differences in NAT1 activity, particularly the knockout of NAT1, significantly alters the bioenergetics profile of MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells.
multiple populations in breast cancer can be segregated based on NAT1 mRNA levels; for patients with low expression, overall survival is significantly less than for patients with intermediate or high expression; low NAT1 expression shows a distinct poor response to chemotherapy
We propose that phenotypic designations as 'rapid' and 'slow' acetylator should be discontinued for NAT1 alleles, although these designations remain very appropriate for NAT2 alleles.
