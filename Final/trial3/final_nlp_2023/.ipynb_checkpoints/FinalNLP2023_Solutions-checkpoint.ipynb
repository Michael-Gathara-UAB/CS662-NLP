    "\n",
    "#### Write code to find the best N candidate concepts for the mention using SAPBERT in the small (for final exam performance purposes) merged kgs vocabularuy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signature of the function should look something like this:\n",
    "``` \n",
    "def getCandidates(mention_embeddings, vocabulary_embeddings, max_candidates):\n",
    "```\n",
    "* mention_embeddings would be SAPBERT embeddings of the mentions\n",
    "* vocabulary_embeddings would be SAPBERT embeddings of the kgs vocabulary. You generate them using just DO concept text, just HPO concept text or perform a function to aggregate them.\n",
    "* max_candidates (max candidates to return from kgs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns a list of the best N matches between the mention and the target merged knowledge graph based on feature similarity between the input node and the target node. Each match in the list is a tuple can contain any elements you need, but it should at least contain\n",
    " * a reference to the target concept, ie) row index|vocabulary_id\n",
    " * score (optional) or anything else you think you need\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Write code to get a set of features for each candidate concepts that can be used for ranking the top N concepts to pick the most correct concept\n",
    "The getFeatures function should generate features for an input mention text and one possible candidate mapping.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def getFeatures(mention_text, candidate_tuple_from_getCandidates)\n",

    "These features will be used in Part 1b) to generate training data for a machine learning ranking algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Masters student need at least 2 features in their getFeatures code, some examples of lexical features include:\n",
    "* counts of matching words or characters\n",
    "* longest common subsequence (RougeL)\n",
    "* ngram overlap, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "PhD Students will need an additional graph-based feature using relations in the ontology or ontology node vector representations such as node2vec. For example, one relevant feature may be checking the similarity of the input node to the parent node of the target. They can also be generated per random-walks like node2vec.\n",

    " * my advice is to do the minimal amount of work and come back later if you want to add more features\n",
    " * you may use ANY additional libraries as need"
