    "The best thing about GPT4 is that it excels in text generation. This makes it perfect for generating synthetic corpora. One of the biggest problems is that it needs a couple examples of data to copy as the accuracy increases with more examples, often called x-shot prompting. As the data is already rare, it may be hard to find examples unless a doctor/specialist feeds it data. This is well highlighted in the paper <font color=\"red\">Can Synthetic Text Help Clinical Named Entity Recognition? A Study of Electronic Health Records in French</font> (Hiebel et al., 2023).

In the paper above, they suggest evaluating using ngram overlap and named entity recognition. These two methods already offer a great way to evaluate the data; However, I would also propose that a researcher to look into utilizing Ontology coverage whereas the breadth of the HPO ensures the presence and frequency of the new terms in the corpora are represented adequately. One may also consider use-case simulation whereas you simulate utilizing the new findings to make clinical decisions which are similar in nature to those made before.\n",
