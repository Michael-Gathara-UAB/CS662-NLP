['we investigated how Azorhizobium caulinodans regulates ROS resistance. We found that in-frame deletions of a gene encoding the putative catalase-peroxidase katG or a gene encoding a LysR-family regulatory protein, oxyR, exhibited increased sensitivity to H2O2 We then showed that OxyR positively regulated katG expression in an H2O2-independent fashion [oxyR].\n',

 'We identified a CheZ-like protein among Alphaproteobacteria functioning in chemotaxis and the A. caulinodans-S. rostrata symbiosis [CheZ].\n']
